This is a <strong>security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>\n<p>WordPress versions 4.7 and earlier are affected by eight security issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remote code execution (RCE) in PHPMailer &#8211; <em>No specific issue appears to affect WordPress</em> or any of the major plugins we investigated but, out of an abundance of caution, we updated PHPMailer in this release.

WordPress 4.7.1 limits this to only¬†post types which have specified that they should be shown¬†within the REST API.

Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I¬†also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4588";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:328:"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

Golunski demonstrated how, under certain circumstances, an attacker could intercept the password reset email and gain access to a user&#8217;s account.</p>\n<p>His proof of concept takes advantage of WordPress using the SERVER_NAME variable to get the hostname of the server in order to create a From/Return-Path header of the outgoing password reset email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Major web servers such as Apache by default set the SERVER_NAME variable using the hostname supplied by the client (within the HTTP_HOST header):</p>\n<p>https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname</p>\n<p>Because SERVER_NAME can be modified, an attacker could set it to an arbitrary domain of his choice e.g:</p>\n<p>attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>which would result in WordPress setting the $from_email to </p>\n<p>wordpress@attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>and thus result in an outgoing email with From/Return-Path set to this malicious address.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results of this particular attack would depend on the server environment, the specific configuration of the mail server, and in some cases would require interaction from the user in question. Golunski&#8217;s <a href="https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html" target="_blank">report</a> has a more specific breakdown of the possible methods that could be employed.</p>\n<p>After reporting the issue to the WordPress security team in July 2016 and also via the HackerOne website, Golunski saw no progress on it and decided to release the vulnerability details to the public.</p>\n<p>Although there is no official patch yet, WordPress Security Czar Aaron Campbell said the issue is not quite as severe as it may seem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lower priority issue, but we are aware of it and it is in our queue to address,&#8221; Campbell said. He explained the unique set of conditions that would be required in order for this to be a serious vulnerability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order for the issue to have a security impact, a server needs to allow a user-supplied header to overwrite <code>$_SERVER[''SERVER_NAME'']</code>,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;We would consider that a poor server configuration (like leaving <code>display_errors</code> on on a production server), which is unfortunately outside our control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell tested his personal Apache and nginx servers and none of them allowed for this. In addition to having a poorly configured server, Campbell said one of the following actions also needs to happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a user needs to reply to a password reset email</li>\n<li>an auto-reply needs to reply to the E-Mail and include the original</li>\n<li>an E-Mail server has to be compromised or overloaded and the message returned to sender with content intact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;If your server is susceptible and you don&#8217;t have the ability to fix the actual server configuration, you still don&#8217;t have to make changes to WordPress files to mitigate the issue,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;A little PHP like this in a plugin will set the from E-Mail to a static E-Mail address of your choice:&#8221;</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( ''wp_mail_from'', function( $from_email ) { return ''wordpress@mysite.com''; } );</code></p>\n<p>Campbell said any changes WordPress makes to core will likely be done via a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25239" target="_blank">ticket</a> that is currently tracking the issue from a non-security perspective. He said a fix is mostly likely not going to be coming in the next security release, but the team is actively working on it. If they find a good mitigation for the issue, Campbell said they will share it once they have worked through all the potential ramifications.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 May 2017 22:41:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team Considers New Retreat-Style WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69642";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-considers-new-retreat-style-wordcamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3741:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/journey.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/2DEL42UQ7M">Jesse Bowser</a>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/" target="_blank">debating the merits of a new type of WordCamp</a>, a hybrid event with the traditional WordCamp content in a retreat-style format. <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mahype/" target="_blank">Sven Wagener</a> and the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Koln/" target="_blank">K√∂ln meetup group</a> in Germany, which has more than 700 members, have proposed a new style of camp that would potentially be called &#8220;WordCamp in the Green&#8221; or &#8220;WordCamp Retreat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event would be held outside of town at a venue where all attendees stay in the same hotel. In addition to the regular WordCamp sessions and Contributor Day, attendees have the opportunity to participate in local outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is open to considering different formats for WordCamps that serve a specific niche. <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-to-be-held-in-denver-august-17-19" target="_blank">WordCamp for Publishers</a>, the first WordCamp focused around a specific topic, is a recent example of this flexibility.</p>\n<p>The proposed format is very similar to the interest-based meetups that the <a href="https://wptavern.com/community-translation-and-wapuu-how-japan-is-shaping-wordpress-history" target="_blank">Japanese WordPress community</a> has been doing for years. Members spend time together in activities unrelated to WordPress, as opposed to simply focusing on improving technical skills, and as a result they become more connected with their local community. For example, the <a href="http://2014onsen.wbsendai.com/" target="_blank">WordÊ∏©Ê≥â (WordOnsen) meetup</a> includes members who enjoy hot springs. They gather in Fukushima where they stay at the same hotel, host WordPress sessions, and end with a party night. This format has successfully grown the Japanese meetup community to more than 50 local groups.</p>\n<p>The K√∂ln meetup group&#8217;s proposal for a WordCamp doesn&#8217;t stray too far from the traditional WordCamp program, as the only differences seem to be a more rural setting where everyone stays at the same venue. A more radical change would be an event where WordPress community members meet simply for networking and connecting with no planned educational component. These types of niche unofficial WordCamps have been happening for years outside of the WordPress-sanctioned events.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is seeking feedback on the proposed &#8220;WordCamp Retreat,&#8221; as approval of the event would set a precedent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we introduce a new type of WordCamp event like this, we want it to be something that works in many communities, scales effectively for larger (or smaller) groups, and is able to be reproduced by any organizers who wish to do so,&#8221; Commnity Team member Hugh Lashbrooke said.</p>\n<p>The organizing team for the proposed WordCamp has already prepared a budget and is ready to move forward once given approval. Lashbrooke said the Community Team anticipates the new event types will have &#8220;a huge amount of interest from other communities around the world,&#8221; so they wanted to pitch it to the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>If you have strong opinions on the topic, you can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/" target="_blank">join the discussion on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 May 2017 02:05:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 271 ‚Äì Recapping WordCamp Chicago 2017 With John James Jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=69622&preview=true&preview_id=69622";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-271-recapping-wordcamp-chicago-2017-with-john-james-jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2066:"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a>.

In the beginning it was going to be the short(ish) story of my first year with WordPress and the lessons I‚Äôve learned about myself. It always ends up being a long and boring story of a year of my life without ever getting to the purpose of why I want to share it. I‚Äôve decided to over simplify it as much as possible, in order to get to the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. If you really want to read about my ‚ÄòWordPress Year 1‚Äô you can probably put most of it together from reading my blog for 2016.</p>\n<p>So in the spirit of TL;DR:</p>\n<p>After an amazing first WordCamp experience at WordCamp Cape Town 2015 I chose the path of freelance WordPress developer. My current situation doesn&#8217;t lend itself to being employed full time and I decided (at the time possibly stupidly) that building WordPress websites was what I was going to do. It would be easy right?</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had a developer license for the Divi theme and all I had to do was find small business clients to build websites for. What could possibly go wrong?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spent the first year banging my head against a quite a few walls, trying to expand my mind, my skills and my experience to reach a goal that, for me anyway, was wholly unobtainable. In the end I realised the what I needed to do was trust in myself and my experience, find a better system for obtaining work and focus on the areas that I was actually good at.</p>\n<p>I also learned the importance of community.</p>\n<p>What follows are the notes I would send to myself, were I able to send a time capsule back one year, to be read on January 1, 2016. Hopefully it helps someone else out there.</p>\n<h3>The WordPress community is an amazing thing.</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve often said that the reason everyone in the community is (mostly) so open and welcoming and helpful is that it was founded in the spirit of open source. Open source software at it‚Äôs core is about being free, open and available, the ability to question a specific solution and find answers to problems and being able to extend and adapt to new requirements. The WordPress community is that in spades. Sure, there are some aspects of it that can get brutal or nasty, sometimes some parts of the community feel unheard or ignored and when I read about things like that it makes me sad. In my experience it has been a positive part of my journey.</p>\n<blockquote><p>From the local WordPress South Africa Slack team, to the two WordCamps in Cape Town and Johannesburg I attended this year, all the way to the international Slacks, forums and Facebook groups, almost everyone I‚Äôve dealt with is positive and supportive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôve contacted CEOs and owners of premium WordPress business, asking them questions via Slack. Every time they answered. In what corporate culture does the owner or CEO of a company take time to answer some random developer question? I‚Äôve met some amazing people, locally and internationally, in person and online, and they have all been the same. Friendly, helpful and willing to answer questions. I can honestly say that without the help and support of the WordPress community I would have been able to make it ‚Äòon my own‚Äô last year.</p>\n<h3>Being a freelancer is more about finding your purpose and less about finding clients.</h3>\n<p>I spent the majority of 2016 trying to force myself down a new path. One where I had little or no experience and where I was surrounded by giants. My gut told me that clients would be looking for websites. So building websites with WordPress became the logical step. However I am not a web designer, a content strategist or an SEO expert. In the words of Jeremy Clarkson, ‚ÄòHow hard can it be?‚Äô. I soon learned how hard. While it is good to try and expand on your weaknesses, trying to earn an income this way is eventually going to kill you. The path to true work/life fulfilment lies at the intersection of that which you love, that which you are good at, that which the world needs and (most importantly) that which you can be paid for (the Japanese call it ‚ÄòIkigai‚Äô, roughly translated as ‚Äòa reason for being‚Äô).</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest mistake I made was thinking that because of WordPress there would be no work for a PHP developer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I soon learned that the reality was that because of WordPress there was an abundance of work for a PHP developer, I was just looking at it the wrong way. Once I knew what my Ikigai was, finding the right platform and clients to match that became much, much easier.</p>\n<h3>Never judge your experience based on someone else.</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôll be the first to admit, I‚Äôm not the most up to date of developers. I only recently really grasped the concepts of name spacing and I still don‚Äôt quite get the whole MySQL character set thing. And that is OK. Being a developer is more about solving a problem than¬†the tools you use to do so. There isn‚Äôt one ‚Äòright‚Äô way to build a plugin. There are a few recommended ways, which often differ from each other in small but important ways but they are all ‚Äòthe right way‚Äô. The important thing is to pay attention to things like standards, simplicity and security. Everything else can be learned from others. The beauty of an open source project is that everyone is learning from the community. So whatever I don‚Äôt know I can learn from someone else. At the end of the day the community benefits and you benefit. (also, refer back to ‚ÄòThe WordPress community is an amazing thing‚Äô).</p>\n<h3>Look after yourself.</h3>\n<p>These seem obvious, but I soon found myself in some very bad patterns. Sleep was the first to go. It is way too easy to end up working until 1 or 2am, ‚Äòjust to get this one thing finished‚Äô. That‚Äôs great if you can sleep in the next morning, but when you are guaranteed to be woken at around 7am by your 5 year old, it soon starts adding up.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once the sleep deprivation starts the bad food choices kick in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Coffee becomes more of a crutch than an enjoyment and meal time decision making is ruled more by what tastes nice than what is healthy. Eventually you end up getting sick for a week and you are so run down you get nothing done until you recover, meaning your earning potential lessens. So you start trying to work longer hours. It is a vicious cycle. The problem, however, is actually a bit deeper&#8230;.</p>\n<h3>Your time is valuable.</h3>\n<p>The quickest way to the downward sleep/life cycle is to devalue yourself and your time.</p>\n<p>Learn to estimate better. Spend more (paid) time on researching the intricacies of a project to ensure you have thought about everything you can, then estimate accordingly. Otherwise you end up realising you missed something half way through, and you have to make a choice. Usually that choice is to suck up the time and add the feature. That is the wrong choice.</p>\n<p>Your time is valuable. It is better to admit to a client that you missed something and that you will need to adjust the time line or quote than to try and kill yourself to make it based on your original estimates. Worse case the client says no and cancels the project. Learn and apply the knowledge to the next one. Better case they agree to give you more time but not more money. Well at least you aren‚Äôt going to kill yourself to get it done. Best case they understand everyone is human. I‚Äôve rarely found clients who don‚Äôt get it.</p>\n<h3>You are capable.</h3>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this? &#8211; You have a project coming up. You&#8217;ve done all the ground work and made sure you&#8217;ve estimated to the best of your abilities, but suddenly you are gripped with fear/concern/worry that the actual project is going to be above your capabilities. So you keep putting it off and do other less important things, trying to build up the courage to tackle it. When you eventually sit down and start you realise it is well within your capabilities and had you started sooner you would probably be done already, instead of now where you are a bit behind and you&#8217;ll have to either work in some extra time to make that deadline or come up with some excuse as to why you missed it.</p>\n<p>All. The. Damn. Time.</p>\n<p>Stop it. You can do it. You‚Äôve done it a 100 times before. Trust in your experience and yourself.</p>\n<p>So in short, sleep more, worry less, rely on those around you and just get on with doing what you do best. It isn&#8217;t really much simpler than that. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why I tried to make it more complicated than what it¬†is, but perhaps that is another journey in the human psyche, for another day.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Notes From My Former Self" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Notes%20From%20My%20Former%20Self&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Notes From My Former Self" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F&title=Notes+From+My+Former+Self" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Notes From My Former Self"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/050317-min-1-150x150.jpg&description=Notes From My Former Self" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Notes From My Former Self"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/" title="Notes From My Former Self"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/">Notes From My Former Self</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 May 2017 11:00:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Jonathan Bossenger";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"Akismet: Limited Time 20% Discount off all Jetpack Plans";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1931";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/05/03/discount-off-jetpack-plans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1119:"<p>As part of #SmallBusinessWeek, Jetpack and Akismet¬†are offering a limited time 20% discount off all Jetpack&#8217;s¬†<a href="https://jetpack.com/pricing/">paid plans</a>¬†&#8212;

In line with previous years&#8217; events that were hosted in major U.S. tech hubs (San Francisco and Austin), WooConf 2017 will be held in Seattle. The organizing team, which is made up of almost a dozen people from around the world of WooCommerce, is planning for 500 attendees.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce downloads have doubled from 12 million in 2016 to 24 million today. The plugin is active on more than 3 million websites and has a strong third-party plugin and theme ecosystem contributing to its growth.</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s speaker lineup will feature more than 30 sessions aimed at developers, along with hands-on workshops. Organizers announced the event with a note that this edition of WooConf will cater specifically to developers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anyone who runs their business with WooCommerce will enjoy WooConf. However, we‚Äôre building out this year‚Äôs speaker list and workshops to appeal mainly to freelancers, agencies, WooExperts, and other developers working with WooCommerce on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>This includes anyone writing code, designing websites, or working with clients as a project manager or business owner. It also includes those of you who design, customize, and write code for your own store (or lend your services to a friend now and then).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s conference in Austin included content for both store owners and developers, and attendees were a mixture of experts and casual WooCommerce fans. The organizing team decided that the event could benefit from a more narrow focus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, we realized that we need to focus on either developers or store owners,&#8221; WooConf co-organizer Patrick Rauland said. &#8220;The content at last year&#8217;s WooConf was great. But you can&#8217;t have two priorities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to have a conference that&#8217;s remarkable, meaning people talk about it. There are a lot of great WordPress events and a lot of great e-commerce events. We want people to talk about WooConf in both of those circles. And by focusing on one target we hope to achieve that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaker submissions are already open and the suggested topics reflect this year&#8217;s developer focus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running an Agency / Client Relations ‚Äì Scoping projects, fostering repeat business, keeping projects on track, finding and hiring developers, productizing client functionality and so on.</li>\n<li>Extending WooCommerce ‚Äì Using the REST API, JavaScript frameworks (React &#038; Backbone), case studies on customization, tips and tricks for customizing specific parts of WooCommerce (emails, checkout flow, product pages and so on) and accessibility.</li>\n<li>Scaling ‚Äì Anything from server-side, backend, frontend or case studies</li>\n<li>eCommerce Fundamentals ‚Äì Creating a cohesive experience (between multiple sites, apps, mobile sites, Amazon, etc), personalization, conversion rate optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://wooconf.com/product/early-bird-ticket/" target="_blank">Early bird tickets</a> for WooConf are on sale for $499 until July 1 when the price will go up $200.</p>\n<p>Organizers will also be hosting the Golden Ticket competition this year, which offers prospective attendees the chance to win an all-expenses-paid trip to the event in Seattle, including travel, accommodation, and admission to the conference. Developers who want to be considered are asked to create a video showing how they use WooCommerce and post it to Instagram. The call for submissions will kick off later this month and the competition has historically been fairly stiff. In 2014, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2014/08/case-study-o-v-e-r-clothing/" target="_blank">Sinisa from OVER Clothing</a> won out over 2,000 other entrants.</p>\n<p>WooConf 2017 will take place at <a href="https://www.bellharbor.com/" target="_blank">Bell Harbor International Conference Center</a>, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and many hotels. For the thousands of WooCommerce developers and enthusiasts around the world who are not able to attend, a live streaming option will be available and recorded talks will be published after the event.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 May 2017 02:36:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.3.1 Now Available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1928";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/05/02/akismet-wordpress-plugin-3-3-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1383:"<p>Version 3.3.1 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>For a full list of the changes in this release, see the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=1649900&stop_rev=1604754+&limit=100&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=">revision log</a>, but here are the highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A couple of bugs that could cause PHP warnings in the error log have been fixed.</li>\n<li>Performance has been improved by preventing some comments-specific code from running on pages without comments.</li>\n<li>Both the &#8220;Remove author URL&#8221; and link preview features now work after a comment is Quick Edited in wp-admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

WP Elevation is joining the observance this year with a special emphasis on freelancers and the tech industry. The company, which provides education for WordPress consultants, will be <a href="http://www.wpelevation.com/wp-elevation-mental-health-month/" target="_blank">focusing all of its content on mental health topics</a>, including blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and livestreams.</p>\n<p>The WP Elevation podcast will feature interviews with mental health experts on Thursdays throughout May:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>May 4: Ed Finkler from <a href="https://osmihelp.org/" target="_blank">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a>, interviewed by Gin McInneny</li>\n<li>May 11: Cory Miller from <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">iThemes</a>, interviewed by Kristina Romero</li>\n<li>May 18: Andrew Pearce from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnxietyTaskforce/" target="_blank">Anxiety Free Living</a>, interviewed by Cath Hughes</li>\n<li>May 25: Amy Felman ‚Äì Psychologist and Podcast Presenter of <a href="http://weallwearitdifferently.com/" target="_blank">We All Wear it Differently</a>, interviewed by Mike Killen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP Elevation founder Troy Dean said various employees at the company have been affected by mental health issues and are often conscious of how digital life can keep people separated from each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have experienced anxiety and depression in the past &#8211; to the point where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed some days,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I work very hard to manage my mental health these days through exercise, family life, and hobbies, as well as working hard in business which I find fulfilling. We will be sharing some of our personal stories on our blog during May.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Focusing on mental health topics is a drastic change from WP Elevation&#8217;s normal business topics, but Dean said he hasn&#8217;t even thought about how it might affect the company&#8217;s revenue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We all believe that mental health issues are still weighed down with a certain stigma and we want to encourage people to be more open in having these conversations,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I actually don‚Äôt care whether it affects my revenue or not. Without good mental health, revenue is meaningless.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working within the WordPress community comes with its own set of unique mental health risks, as many people have their lives deeply embedded in online work. Those who work remotely or by themselves have a greater likelihood of feeling isolated and cut off from others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The digital life can keep us isolated for periods of time as we toil away on our projects in front of our computers,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I‚Äôve met a lot of WordPress users over the years at WordCamps who have confided in me that the events are so important because they get to connect with their tribe. I think there is also a risk of online bullying that can make people feel inadequate or ostracized.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Elevation will be supporting <a href="https://osmihelp.org/" target="_blank">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> (OSMI), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting mental wellness and providing resources for those facing mental illness in the tech community.

Last year 10up worked with <a href="https://www.joyent.com/" target="_blank">Joyent</a>, a cloud infrastructure company, to create a production-ready implementation of WordPress in Docker. After their experience with this project, 10up created WP Docker as a simple, open source development environment based on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank">docker-compose</a>.</p>\n<p>Docker is a virtualization technology that allows developers to work on websites and applications in isolated containers. It has many advantages over Vagrant, which takes up a lot more space with each virtual machine having its own operating system included. Docker runs off of a single Linux instance and the containers hold the application and its dependencies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While still viable, VVV, Vagrant, and Virtual Box/Hyper-V take up extreme disk space and are slow to provision, start up, and SSH into,&#8221; 10up Director of Engineering Taylor Lovett said. &#8220;Because of this, engineers tend to use one &#8216;mega&#8217; VVV install for all of their development websites. This workflow poses a number of problems: system service version and configuration &#8216;normalization&#8217; across all projects (i.e. PHP 7 on everything when some projects run PHP 5.6 in production), and legacy clutter (i.e. old websites and system packages undeleted).&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Docker is much more lightweight than VVV and starts up much faster. It comes packaged with Elasticsearch by default, so 10up&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/" target="_blank">ElasticPress</a> plugin works out-of-the-box. The environment includes the following technologies by default:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP7</li>\n<li>MariaDB</li>\n<li>NGINX</li>\n<li>Elasticsearch</li>\n<li>Gearman</li>\n<li>Memcached</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a> was started by a former 10up employee, Jeremy Felt, and the company still uses the project for local development in many cases. Certain instances, however, may lend themselves more to using VVV as opposed to WP Docker. Lovett said those include projects that are highly dependent on specific versions of system packages, such as PHP 5.6 and Elasticsearch 5.1.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Docker lends itself well to enterprise clients that want to version control an environment specifically for their web application to be distributed to developers,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;This is common for large clients with large development teams. WP Docker lets a team standardize on a local setup which decreases bugs and &#8216;I see this but you don&#8217;t&#8217; issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lovett said teams at 10up are still using VVV more often than WP Docker since it&#8217;s still quite new, but the company plans to let project requirements and team preferences drive adoption. The project is <a href="https://github.com/10up/wp-docker" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> and has nearly 80 stars less than a week after its release.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 May 2017 19:52:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"BuddyPress: Total Wellness Challenge: Fitness with BuddyPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=265691";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/total-wellness-challenge-fitness-with-buddypress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9175:"<div><em>This a guest post by Tara Claeys (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/taraclaeys">taraclaeys</a>) of <a href="https://designtlc.com/">Design TLC, LLC</a>.

The business grew and Ginny expanded into nutrition and wellness coaching. As a result, she began offering ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù on printed sheets to her clients a few years later. They could track their daily wellness activities (nutrition, fitness, and mental health) on the sheet, giving themselves points for good behaviors and subtracting points for negative activities. This ‚Äúgame‚Äù became popular among her clients, just as online wellness communities started offering similar experiences on websites and apps.</p>\n<p>Tara Claeys, a fitness client and friend, offered to help Ginny expand her existing WordPress site by adding a membership component, allow commenting to create interaction between members, and also include the ability for people to track their ‚ÄúChallenge Points‚Äù online using a Google Spreadsheet. This was the rudimentary beginning of the online program for her Challenges.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>In 2015, Ginny decided to brand her Challenges and decided to launch a separate website for this program, The <a href="https://twcfit.com/">Total Wellness Challenge</a> (TWC). Her goal was to expand the program beyond her fitness clients and to offer branded Challenges for corporate wellness programs. Tara worked with her to create a multisite installation with BuddyPress and  MemberPress that would have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subsites for individual, private Challenges in corporate and other groups</li>\n<li>Restricted access to Challenges for members only</li>\n<li>Allow a ‚ÄúReflections‚Äù commenting page for Challengers to interact with each other</li>\n<li>Point Logging for 3 components of the Challenge\n<ul>\n<li>Limit submission to same day after 8pm until next day until 5pm. </li>\n<li>Allow users to select one day to be a ‚ÄúFree‚Äù day where they would receive the maximum nutrition score, no matter what they ate</li>\n<li>Add a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù point automatically if a user logs 5 consecutive 12-point days</li>\n<li>Show points for all Challengers on a Totals Page</li>\n<li>Limits to only one entry per user per day</li>\n<li>Each category (nutrition, fitness, lifestyle) has limit on max points per day </li>\n<li>Ability for admin to edit user points on the back end</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tara hired <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaransom?lang=en">Tom Ransom</a> of <a href="https://www.1bigidea.com/">One Big Idea</a> to help develop a custom plugin that would connect MemberPress with BuddyPress. They chose BuddyPress because is primed for multisite configuration, it worked well with MemberPress, and is very customizable. Plus, the BuddyPress Groups functionality was a good fit for the separate Challenges. For TWC, each Challenge is a unique BuddyPress Group, set up on the front end by the admin. </p>\n<p>The TWC is a point-logging game at its core. Participants keep track of their activity throughout each day for about 4 weeks and must log in to the website each day to record their points. There are 3 components of the Challenge:</p>\n<p><img src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/groups-1024x313.png" alt="TWC groups" width="700" height="214" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-265695" /></p>\n<p><strong>1. Nutrition</strong>: Players can earn up to 12 points per day. Everyone starts the day with 5 points, and can gain points for positive food choices, such as avoiding white flour, eating 3 cups of greens and drinking a specified amount of water based on their weight. Players lose points for unhealthy choices, such as eating too much sugar, eating processed foods, and consuming more than one serving of beer or wine.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fitness</strong>: Players can earn up to 2 points per day. They earn one point for doing 30 minutes or more of exercise per day and another point for stretching for at least 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Lifestyle</strong>: Players earn one point for posting a daily Reflection on the twcfit.com website, and a second point for participating in the lifestyle challenge of the week. Each week, a different lifestyle activity is listed, including behaviors such as noting 3 things you are grateful for each day, getting 7 hours of sleep, or doing an act of kindness for someone. A maximum of 2 lifestyle points can be earned each day.</p>\n<p><img src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/bbg-log-886x1024.jpg" alt="Log Points" width="700" height="809" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-265720" /></p>\n<p>The participant can go to the Totals page to check their score against other players.</p>\n<p><img src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/totals-1024x466.png" alt="Totals page" width="700" height="319" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-265697" /></p>\n<p>Tom‚Äôs plugin includes code that directs the PayPal IPN to the respective subsite for MemberPress (MP) purchases. In addition, this plugin adds the new MP user into the corresponding BuddyPress group once the MP transaction was returned compete.

For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>activity &gt; post-form.php customized ‚ÄúWhat is your reflection for the xx Challenge today, name?‚Äù</li>\n<li>groups &gt; single &gt; group-header.php &#8212; Adds RESOURCES button to header<br /><img src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/bp-customization.jpg" alt="BuddyPress Customization" width="235" height="139" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-265719" />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The site also uses the  BuddyPress Custom Profile Menu and Custom User Profile Photo plugins.</p>\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n<p>Over the past 13+ years, Ginny has hired 4 instructors, expanded her business to McLean, Virginia, and wrote the ‚Äú<a href="http://bodybyginny.com/good-food-recipe-book-by-ginny-wright/">Good Food Recipe Book</a>‚Äù which is available for sale on her website.  At this time, Ginny is still deciding whether she wants to invest in marketing Total Wellness Challenge or keep it small, mostly based on word of mouth. The increased competition in this space has made it harder to gain exposure without a large marketing budget.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://twcfit.com/">Total Wellness Challenge</a> website has been running well for a little over a year. Six Challenges have been conducted so far, and participants have loved interacting with each other. Tara and Tom are happy with the positive feedback on their customized ‚Äúgamification‚Äù of BuddyPress and how it has helped provide additional clients and exposure for Ginny‚Äôs outdoor boot camps. </p>\n<div>\n<img src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/taraclaeys.jpeg" alt="Tara Claeys" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-265693" /> <em><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/taraclaeys">Tara Claeys</a> of <a href="https://designtlc.com/">Design TLC, LLC</a> provides custom website and graphic design services, with a focus on creating effective, clean and personal communication platforms for small businesses.

The plugin allowed users to create &#8220;Buy Buttons&#8221; for products from their Shopify stores and insert them into WordPress posts and pages using a shortcode. It was built by <a href="https://webdevstudios.com/" target="_blank">WebDevStudios</a> and had approximately 9,000 active installations before it was removed.</p>\n<p>Shopify&#8217;s <a href="https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/buy-button/wordpress-for-shopify" target="_blank">documentation</a> says the plugin has been discontinued and will not be supported after June 30, 2017. WordPress users who want to display Shopify products on their sites are now instructed to <a href="https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/buy-button/create-buy-button" target="_blank">create a Buy Button for a product or collection</a> and paste the embed code into WordPress instead.</p>\n<p>The WordPress plugin team would not comment on why the plugin was removed, but a support representative from Shopify said it was outdated and difficult to maintain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason it was removed is that it was being replaced by Buy Button, which is a better way of selling in WordPress,&#8221; Shopify customer support representative Jacquelyn Failano said. &#8220;The WordPress plugin was built by a third party and even if we support it, it could break at any time as we make future updates to the Buy Button channel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Failano said that by switching from using the plugin to creating Buy Buttons with Shopify, users will have access to updated features, including fonts, colors, layouts, buttons, and multiple images on variants. Merchants will also be in a better position to take advantage of future updates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin uses older code and methods that will no longer be updated or supported,&#8221; Failano said. &#8220;There is no longer a dedicated development team for it. This means that there are no resources to maintain or rebuild the plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Failano would not confirm whether or not the plugin was removed from the directory by Shopify at the company&#8217;s discretion or whether it was forcibly removed by WordPress for a violation of the guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I cannot confirm on that part &#8211; the main reason why it was discontinued was because the plugin uses older code and methods that will no longer be updated or supported,&#8221; Failano said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 02:02:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: How the San Francisco WordPress Meetup is Using Open Collective to Fund Activities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69286";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5065:"<p>In 2016, WordPress meetups had the fastest growth the community has seen in five or six years with more than 62,566 people attending in 58 different countries. Meetups are the seeds of future WordCamps. These local gatherings help users further their WordPress skills and underpin the community&#8217;s growth across the globe.</p>\n<p>Funding a local meetup can be a challenge, as organizers often have to seek out sponsors just like a WordCamp but at a smaller scale. The San Francisco WordPress meetup (WPSFO) is trying something new by publicly managing its budget and expenses with <a href="https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf" target="_blank">Open Collective</a>. Last week we featured the service in an <a href="https://wptavern.com/open-collective-is-a-new-transparent-way-to-fund-open-source-projects" target="_blank">article</a> and WPSFO lead organizer Shannon Dunn commented on his meetup&#8217;s experience with it so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It creates a level of transparency for the whole community and lets current and prospective customers understand where the money goes,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re pretty happy with it and it&#8217;s an integral part of managing our meetup.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wpsfo.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Dunn started attending and helping out with WPSFO in 2011 and stepped up to be lead organizer at the beginning of 2016. Former lead organizer Zach Berke, who started in 2007, was the one who initially suggested the idea of using Open Collective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Before we started with Open Collective, sponsors paid for things directly,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had various host sponsors (Automattic, Exygy, Pantheon) that have provided meeting space, food, and drinks. These hosts have always paid for the food directly. We also had a relationship with WPEngine at one point. They paid a videographer to film the meetups. All other expenses, usually for minor things, were paid for by the organizers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said that Open Collective has helped to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for meetup organizers, as it provides a straightforward process for posting expenses and getting reimbursed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Funding a meetup can be pretty tough,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s great that we have hosts to cover the big items, but various other expenses come up. Those small things are usually paid for by the organizers. Also, there are times when one of our primary hosts can&#8217;t provide a space to meet. We have several alternative meeting spaces but not all of them provide food and drinks. On those occasions, organizers have paid for the food and drink out of pocket. We could have gone without, but we try to keep each meetup a consistent experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said the team wanted to cover these costs without digging into the pockets of the organizers, who already volunteer a lot of time and energy to the meetup. They do not charge for the events and don&#8217;t plan on doing it in the future, so having additional funds on hand became a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pia from Open Collective reached out to Zach about a year ago,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;Zach had a prior relationship with another OC founder, Xavier, from his early Storify days. Zach agreed to sign up for OC because it seemed to address a pain point. Zach handed the reins of OC to Michelle and I, who have brought sponsors onto the platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said using Open Collective has had many positive advantages over the previous system WPSFO had for managing funds. Receiving donations and submitting expenses is now streamlined into a transparent pipeline. The meetup has an estimated annual budget of $6,658, based on current donations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being able to provide recognition to our sponsors is a big plus,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth noting that this is a young and ever-evolving platform so with that you&#8217;re provided direct access to Open Collective&#8217;s front line, which is beneficial in addressing any questions or concerns that arise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said using Open Collective has opened up additional possibilities, like making WPSFO t-shirts to sell to members and the general public. Having money in the meetup account means the organizers can do it without having to pre-sell the shirts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re floating in cash now, but we have little bit of money to work with,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It feels great to have that and we&#8217;re deeply appreciative of our sponsors for making it possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WPSFO is one of <a href="https://opencollective.com/discover?show=meetup" target="_blank">23 meetups</a> that have started managing their budgets and funds through Open Collective. Other early adopters of the service include multiple WWCode meetups, Women Who Code Atlanta, and SF Data Science Meetup, with budgets ranging from a few hundred dollars to more than $25,000.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:55:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2017 Ramps Up Ticket Sales, Organizers Plan for 2,500 Attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69357";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2017-ramps-up-ticket-sales-organizers-plan-for-2500-attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2418:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wordcamp-us-nashville.jpeg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Promotion for <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp US 2017 in Nashville</a>, December 1-3, is now in full swing, as organizers have ramped up social media efforts to stimulate ticket sales.

Clicking the button will send the content through an API to IBM&#8217;s Watson for analysis.</p>\n<p><img />Watsonfinds Toolbar ButtonWhen an analysis is completed, the results are displayed in a modal window. The report is broken down into five emotions: joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear.</p>\n<p><img />Watsonfinds AnalysisI submitted five posts of various length and each report was generated quickly. Here are the posts I submitted along with the most likely emotional response from readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-close-san-francisco-office">Automattic to Close San Francisco Office</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-shows-users-where-a-plugins-settings-link-is-upon-activation">New WordPress Plugin Shows Users Where a Plugin‚Äôs Settings Link Is Upon Activation</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-4-fixes-visual-editor-incompatibility-with-upcoming-version-of-chrome">WordPress 4.7.4 Fixes 47 Issues</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/heropress-partners-with-wpshout-to-offer-wordpress-education-scholarships">HeroPress Partners With WPShout to Offer WordPress Education Scholarships</a> &#8211; Joy</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-appears-to-be-dying-a-slow-death">Headway Themes Appears to be Dying a Slow Death</a> &#8211; Anger</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within the report is a timeline where you can compare results as you add or remove words to the post.</p>\n<p>During testing, I found the timeline confusing to use as I thought I had to save the post as a draft after each edit to generate a revision on the timeline. To use the timeline, you need to make changes to a post without saving it and then click the Watsonfinds button to generate a new report.</p>\n<p>Being able to see which words are generating the emotions depicted in the report would be a nice feature to have. Guti√©rrez says that this feature is in the works and will be in the commercial version of the plugin. The More Insights tab in the report is an advertisement for the premium version which is not yet available.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.7.4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. While Watsonfinds isn&#8217;t going to change how I write, I can see the potential benefits of using such a plugin to try to illicit a certain emotional response from readers and customers whether it&#8217;s a renewal email, blog post, or other copy.</p>\n<p>You can try out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/watsonfinds/">Watsonfinds</a> for free by downloading it from the WordPress plugin directory.

Black Duck conducted audits on more than 1,000 commercial applications in 2016 and analyzed the anonymized data. The audits were primarily related to merger and acquisition transactions but span a wide array of industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, aerospace, aviation, and retail.</p>\n<p>Open source security and license compliance issues can both pose serious financial threats to a company. Black Duck&#8217;s findings show 96% of applications scanned include open source software and the average app included 147 unique open source components. The majority of these applications (67%) contained security issues which have been publicly known for an average of four years. These included high-risk and well-known vulnerabilities such as Poodle, Freak, Drown, and Heartbleed.</p>\n<p>License compliance issues were even more widespread than the security issues. Black Duck&#8217;s audits found 85% of the applications had components with license conflicts. Although 75% of the audited applications included GPL-licensed components, only 45% of them were fully in compliance with the license. The audits also revealed that 53% of the scanned applications had components with &#8220;unknown&#8221; licenses, which generally means the components were used without permission from their creators.</p>\n<h3>How GPL Compliance Efforts Affect the Future of the Copyleft Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Stephen O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s recent <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/01/13/the-state-of-open-source-licensing/" target="_blank">article</a> on Redmonk.com hails the decline of GPL, referencing repositories surveyed by Black Duck that demonstrate the once-dominant GPL license is &#8220;steadily eroding, giving way to licenses at the opposite, permissive end of the spectrum.&#8221; Although developers and companies are readily embracing open source software, the trend is towards more permissive licenses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Black Duck‚Äôs sample, the most popular variant of the GPL ‚Äì version 2 ‚Äì is less than half as popular as it was (46% to 19%),&#8221; O&#8217;Grady said. &#8220;Over the same span, the permissive MIT has gone from 8% share to 29%, while its permissive cousin the Apache License 2.0 jumped from 5% to 15%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a reaction <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/2/decline-gpl" target="_blank">article on Opensource.com</a>, Jono Bacon said he has witnessed this same trend with the GPL falling out of favor in terms of practicality for business owners who are uncomfortable with meeting its black and white demands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In recent years though we have seen a newer generation of developers form for whom there is a less critical, and if I dare say it, less religious focus on freedom,&#8221; Bacon said. &#8220;For them, open source is a pragmatic and practical component in building software as opposed to an ethical choice, and I suspect this is why we have seen such a growth in the use of MIT and Apache licenses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The complexity of compliance is one of the chief drawbacks for those who feel uncomfortable using GPL-licensed code. If Black Duck&#8217;s open source application audits are any indication, commercial adoption of the GPL has not come with adequate education on license compliance.</p>\n<p>However, GPL enforcement rarely leads to litigation. In an article that outlines the Free Software Foundation&#8217;s (FSF) stance on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2016/fall/the-role-of-lawsuits-in-gpl-compliance" target="_blank">the role of lawsuits in GPL compliance</a>, Donald Robertson said compliance is almost always an educational matter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most violators are unaware of their obligations under the license and simply need additional help to come into compliance,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;Almost all GPL compliance cases end quietly with the violator correcting their mistakes, with only a minimal notification of past recipients of the then-violating distribution that anything has happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Robertson emphasized that lawsuits should be a last resort but must remain a legitimate option. FSF&#8217;s compliance efforts focus on educating violators, but the organization reserves the right to take action on those who knowingly choose to violate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat of litigation provides leverage that we need with the rare violators whose GPL compliance problems are not merely mistakes, but are intentional attempts to limit their users&#8217; freedom,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;While compliance work is primarily educational, we need a tool that can work with the rare few who are already educated but chose to violate anyway. Copyleft was designed from the start to serve as that tool.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software Freedom Law Center president and executive director Eben Moglen spoke at the SFLC&#8217;s conference last October about <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/eben-moglen-gpl-compliance-and-building-communities-what-works" target="_blank">open source license compliance</a>. He urged listeners to consider the perception of the GPL in the industry at large when weighing the costs of litigating compliance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not and we never were copyright maximalists,&#8221; Moglen said. &#8220;We did not do what we have been doing for the past 30 years to build free software on the basis of the assumption that freedom required us to chase down and punish everybody who ever made a mistake or who even deliberately misused copyrighted software made for sharing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moglen said that in situations where it is appropriate to make an example, it is important to declare that you are in a last-resort situation with no other options besides litigation. Securing compliance by force can damage companies&#8217; trust in using the GPL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Richard Stallman and I had gone to court and sued a major global public company on a claim of copyright infringement that was weak enough to be thrown out of court on a motion to dismiss, we would have destroyed the GPL straightaway,&#8221; Moglen said. &#8220;If we had shown that we were prepared to risk large on coercion, even against a bad actor in our own judgement ‚Äî if we had done that without adequate preparation to be sure that we won &#8211; we would have lost an example of coercion and nobody would have trusted us again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moglen cautioned listeners not to be too quick to take action that might cause people to question whether there is something wrong with copyleft. He advocated spontaneous compliance, as opposed to constantly policing violations, as the most effective way to ensure the future of the GPL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have an opportunity to put this free software where we want it, which is everywhere, and to make it do what we want, which is to spread freedom,&#8221; Moglen said. &#8220;We‚Äôre not in a place where the difficulty is how do we get enough ammunition to force everybody to comply. We don‚Äôt need ammunition. We need diplomacy. We need skill. We need to work together better. We need to understand how that working together purposively brings us to the point where everyone is not afraid of FOSS anymore and we are not worried about their complying anymore. We are just all engaging and leading the task of making free software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moglen encouraged diplomacy and discretion when it comes to compliance because the long-term credibility of the free software community is at stake.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I agree with the people who have suggested that if a campaign of coercive compliance is carried just a moment too far, willingness to use copyleft among the Ôøºrational businesses of the world will decline to a point which is dangerous to freedom,&#8221; Moglen said. &#8220;Because I do believe that copyleft is important to freedom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Black Duck&#8217;s recent audits show that companies struggle with open source risk management and license conflicts are rampant, the good news is that the world is embracing open source software in every industry. Engineers and product managers may not have a full grasp of the requirements of the GPL, but a compliance approach that focuses on education will go a long way towards building a future that includes copyleft software at the core of innovation.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 21:43:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"HeroPress: Hire More Women Developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1739";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://heropress.com/essays/hire-women-developers/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10384:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/042617-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Rarely is a developer or engineer pictured as being female or looking like me. We need to change that." /><blockquote><p>The journey of a Developer that has the pleasure and gratitude of having WordPress as a resource.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Who am I and am I good?</h3>\n<p>We define ourselves in order to navigate life. Like we brand our business or our clients‚Äô websites, we brand ourselves. Remember to define yourself, because others are always going to define you. Be true to yourself.</p>\n<p>I recall the scene in the movie starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Herrington where he‚Äôs improving her social standing. At the end his manners are called into question. He says,</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou see, the great secret, Eliza, is not a question of good manners or bad manners, or any particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls. The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you‚Äôve ever heard me treat anyone else better.‚Äù</p>\n<p>We are all the same, yet different. We all hurt and desire, yet what we are motivated by may be different. Be true to yourself to follow what you know is meant for you. Trust in the journey. For it is the journey, not the destination, that not only makes up one‚Äôs day, but ultimately defines us once we have arrived!</p>\n<h3>Embrace Your Uniqueness</h3>\n<p>When I was in sixth grade, the yearbook asked us what we would like to accomplish. While most of the girls wrote modeling or acting (we are in Southern California after all), I wanted to discover a new animal.</p>\n<p>Discovery has always been one of my passions. WordPress has been a way to discover new ways to combine code to ‚Äòmake things happen‚Äô by creating plugins. WordPress has provided a place to practice the developer&#8217;s craft. I‚Äôm a working dev and I have a lot of gratitude to give the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>I have been given time, support, and much patience. The Meetups have provided a place to gain the ground work. We talk about of what concerns that need attention and best practices to put in place (like ensuring site performance).</p>\n<p>It takes courage to try and fail and fail again. Practice the art of asking lots of questions. Remember, ‚Äúsometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of, that do the things that no one could imagine.‚Äù So even if someone questions your work, whether you could ever possibly have done that or do that, keep going.</p>\n<h3>Stereotypes</h3>\n<p>Imagine an engineer writing a program, a developer creating an application, and a social media specialist crafting creative content. Do you see them at their desks? What does the engineer look like? What does the developer look like? Did you picture them as a female? Typically not. Perhaps the one crafting creative content was pictured as female.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rarely is a developer or engineer pictured as being female or looking anything like me. We need to change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs been proven that when given identical resumes with name either David or Maria, the hiring committee will determine David to be identified as more qualified every time. Maria‚Äôs accomplishments had to be two times better before she is seen as equally qualified as David.</p>\n<p>We, both men and women, hold ‚Äòimplicit biases.&#8217; It is a cultural thing. Men are seen as a more qualified developer. Acknowledging this is the first step.</p>\n<p>What can we do to help turn this around? First, let‚Äôs visit why we should turn this around.</p>\n<h3>Reason for Diversity (Focusing on Women in Engineering)</h3>\n<p>We are facing real, large complex problems as a community that requires developers to figure out. Specifically, in the WordPress world, we need a platform, as well as themes and plugins, that appeals to a large audience. True innovation requires a diverse team. It will ensure that different viewpoints, ideas, and solutions are discovered.</p>\n<p>Women are an asset to the team, especially in the role of developer. Consider the fact that many women are making the buying decisions. A woman developer helps create a product that appeals to a larger audience, which ultimately affects sales. Female developers bring insight to the possibilities of products that are currently missing and overlooked.</p>\n<p>How do we change this? Hire more women developers. Make it a point to include, describe, and depict developers as women in marketing materials. Encourage women to apply for developer positions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you‚Äôre female reading this and you like to problem solve and build things, give development a try.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just because things are the way they are doesn‚Äôt mean they have to stay that way. Typically, women aren‚Äôt developers but that can change. WordPress is a community where women developers thrive. WordPress is stronger as a community because of its diversity of users and creators. We all benefit from diversity. By having diversity within our community, we grow. We build. Ultimately, we create more opportunity for all.</p>\n<h3>Some Obstacles Facing Women In STEM</h3>\n<p>Woman as developers are viewed as being different. Many are questioned why they are doing this. Women will even be treated at as if they shouldn‚Äôt be there. Women are conditioned from a young age to be princesses, not engineers.</p>\n<p>Developers are competitive, like great writers. Competitiveness for the best projects is part of the game. This game is not something that females are ‚Äòtaught‚Äô or necessarily have experience in. Men joke with each other differently than women do. Entering the environment from a female perspective, it may seem aggressive and uninviting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It helps to have experience in team sports to help to manage and navigate the competitive male dominated culture of the field.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another way to ensure success is to join a group that supports women in tech. It will help to deal with issues that arise and gain confidence in an industry that is dominantly male. Typically, women and men communicate differently. Also, I find it a way to relax and relate without needing to worry about so many other unrelated issues. It provides a platform to discuss issues like family, which many times a big impact on a woman‚Äôs career &#8212; especially when she has children.</p>\n<h3>Feminine Aspect</h3>\n<p>Balancing being feminine in a male dominated field can be difficult. According to Marilyn vos Savant, the person with the highest IQ at 200 and famous advice writer, women who play up their sexual attractiveness make themselves appear ‚Äòlightweight‚Äô and lose ‚Äòparity‚Äô with men. This is not okay since a woman faces pressure in society to look attractive and be nurturing. This is similar to how men are valued by being a provider. This is a real dichotomy. Women are not allowed to be seen as sexually-attractive and competent. It is as if there‚Äôs a choice to be made. That is a real problem.</p>\n<h3>What the WordPress Community has Done for Me</h3>\n<p>WordPress is to be a community of people who are curious and solve technical questions. Over the years, there has been an emphasis on marketing and business focus. WordPress grows and continues to grow in popularity, creating more and more opportunity.</p>\n<p>I found the community to be a place to bring questions. It has been a place to find inspiration and to inspire others in my professional journey as a developer. The community has helped me to develop the courage and determination to secure a position as a developer. The WordPress community has been a resource of a network of individuals to turn to for help. It is an open source and sharing community with many talented people.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elizabeth Shilling, a developer with a degree in psychology with a social, developmental emphasis from UC Santa Barbara, specialized in biological sciences, computer science, business, and teaching. Looking at differences between men and women in math and sciences bloomed during research as an undergrad. It was determined to be cultural, not biological. Social expectations dominate the direction of female students away from engineering sciences rather than intellectual capabilities.

As of yesterday, more than 300 of the 500 tickets for <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-announces-speakers-opens-registration-for-contributor-day" target="_blank">Contributor Day</a> have been claimed.</p>\n<p>This year organizers are <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-to-experiment-with-sponsors-workshops" target="_blank">experimenting with sponsor workshops</a>, a perk targeted at the highest levels of sponsorship, which includes Administrator (‚Ç¨ 38,000) and Super Admin (‚Ç¨ 75,000) tiers. This new item in the sponsor&#8217;s package is described as a &#8220;sponsor &#8220;track&#8221; in the <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/files/2016/12/wceu17-sponsorship-kit_122916.pdf" target="_blank">sponsorship kit brochure</a> and allows sponsors to hold a talk or a workshop in a dedicated space that accommodates approximately 200 people.</p>\n<p>In an effort to prevent the event from disproportionately focusing on mega sponsors, the organizing team has created a <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/03/23/wordcamp-europe-2017-sponsorship-exclusively-for-small-business/" target="_blank">new sponsorship package exclusively for small businesses</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We recognized that our sponsorship tiers were more geared towards larger WordPress businesses and felt we were not giving small businesses enough opportunity to showcase their products and services and allow them to connect to attendees,&#8221; WCEU Sponsorship co-organizer Remkus de Vries said. &#8220;This is why we created the SMB tier and we hope many see this as a wonderful chance to show off their products and services for what&#8217;s shaping up to be more than 3,000 attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Small Business sponsorship level is priced at ‚Ç¨ 2,500 and is available to companies that generate the majority of their revenue from WordPress and made less than 1 million euro in revenue in 2016. It qualifies the sponsor for a booth in the middle of the event. The table, banner printing, and setup are all handled by the WCEU Sponsor Team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Similar to TechCrunch‚Äôs Startup Alley, we want to help highlight smaller companies or ones that have just started out,‚Äù WCEU Sponsorship co-organizer Noel Tock said. ‚ÄúSimply seeking out sponsorship funds the fastest way possible would not be fair to attendees. This helps makes the conversations and experiences a lot more diverse and balanced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are 10 remaining Small Business sponsorship slots, along with 288 micro-sponsorships (‚Ç¨ 150.00).

Core contributors have been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/28/the-new-editor-and-browser-support/" target="_blank">discussing</a> <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/03/13/continued-discussion-on-browser-support/" target="_blank">browser support</a> for the past two months in relationship to setting technical requirements for the new editor.</p>\n<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support" target="_blank">discontinued support for IE 8, 9, and 10</a> in January 2016, which means these versions no longer receive security updates. Mullenweg said that attempting to continue supporting these browsers is holding back WordPress development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realize that folks still running these browsers are probably stuck with them because of something out of their control, like being at a library or something,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Depending on how you count it, those browsers combined are either around 3% or under 1% of total users, but either way they‚Äôve fallen below the threshold where it‚Äôs helpful for WordPress to continue testing and developing against.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an effort to determine how many people are still using these insecure and obsolete browsers, Jonathan Desrosiers collected data from three different sources. The following are numbers for global IE usage published by StatCounter&#8217;s <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/" target="_blank">GlobalStats</a>, which Desrosiers said are nearly identical to WordPress.com&#8217;s numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IE8: 0.41%</li>\n<li>IE9: 0.26%</li>\n<li>IE10: 0.26%</li>\n<li>IE11: 3.79%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress will not stop working entirely in these browsers, but after the 4.8 release contributors will no longer test new features against older versions of IE. Some capabilities in wp-admin may be more limited. Mullenweg confirmed that the next versions of TinyMCE will no support older IE versions.</p>\n<p>Global IE usage has declined from 7.44% in March 2016 to 4.18% in March 2017. IE marketshare has been shrinking as mobile device usage has gone up. October 2016 marked the first month in history that <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide" target="_blank">mobile and tablet traffic exceeded desktop usage worldwide</a>. As this trend of declining desktop usage continues, IE will likely be buried within a couple of years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been hard pressed to find a U.S. government agency running a version of IE less than 11,&#8221; WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin commented on the announcement. &#8220;Government agency websites similarly see negligible traffic from IE &lt; 11.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The decision to drop support for IE 8, 9, and 10 was met with celebration from the WordPress developer community. Focusing on browsers that still receive security updates is a better use of open source contributors&#8217; time and resources. Developers who do client work can also refer to WordPress&#8217; IE support policy when pressured by clients to support insecure browsers.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the topic of raising minimum browser requirements resulted in developers lobbying to drop support for PHP 5.2, which reached end of life more than six years ago. In March 2015, <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-version-stats-updated-more-than-13-of-sites-are-running-wordpress-4-1" target="_blank">WordPress stats estimated PHP 5.2 usage at 16.6%</a>, but that number has dropped steadily to <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/stats/" target="_blank">5.1%</a> today. The task of updating a browser to the latest version was designed to be easy for users, but upgrading PHP versions is still somewhat complicated for those who are not receiving help from their hosting companies. The 5.1% on PHP 5.2 represents millions of users who would need to cross a significant hurdle into order to stay current with the latest version of WordPress.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 21:18:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"Post Status: Breaking into and building community, with WordPress and beyond ‚Äî Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=36524";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"https://poststatus.com/breaking-building-community-wordpress-beyond-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1913:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

WordPress developers <a href="https://jkudish.com/2017/04/20/better-plugin-recommendations-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">Joey Kudish</a> and <a href="https://secretpizza.party/wordpress-needs-curation/" target="_blank">Nick Hamze</a> have released a plugin that brings better recommendations to the admin.</p>\n<p>Hamze contends that the first plugins that appear in the featured section have a smaller, niche audience, and are unlikely to be useful to the majority of new users.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/add-new-plugins-featured.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The recommended plugins are slightly better, as they are based on plugins that the user and other users have installed. However, Hamze believes they could be tweaked even further to display plugins that specifically benefit new users. The Recommended tab was <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337" target="_blank">introduced two years ago</a> to display results based on plugins that are commonly used together. It excludes plugins that users already have installed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/recommended-plugins.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I really want to help WordPress but I think what is most needed isn‚Äôt a new editor or more guidelines but rather someone to take all the stuff in this fractured ecosystem and bring it together,&#8221; Hamze said. &#8220;Get rid of all the crap and only show people the stuff worth using.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hamze said he doesn&#8217;t know if WordPress can solve this problem diplomatically with code. He believes manual curation is required to deliver the best new user experience. A <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34212" target="_blank">ticket</a> for re-thinking the default &#8216;Add Plugins&#8217; tabs/filters was is open on WordPress trac, as the plugins that appear in these screens have remained unchanged for some time. The ticket hasn&#8217;t received much discussion yet.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-plugin-recommendations/" target="_blank">Better Plugin Recommendations</a> plugin removes the default and featured recommendations tabs and includes a new recommendations tab curated by Hamze to appeal to new users. Below is an example of the first 10 recommendations the plugin includes:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/better-recommended-plugins.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hamze uses the following criteria to select the recommended plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price (Free)</li>\n<li>Numbers of users</li>\n<li>Average Rating</li>\n<li>Last Updated</li>\n<li>Support Given</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When asked why the recommendations don&#8217;t include Jetpack, Hamze said it didn&#8217;t seem necessary, given its high position in the popular tab and the fact that it already comes pre-installed with many hosts.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jeherve">@jeherve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jkudish">@jkudish</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> Haha, I actually like jetpack but since it''s already at the top of the popular tab and preinstalled almost everywhere, didn''t seem necessary</p>\n<p>&mdash; Nick Hamze (@NickHamze) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickHamze/status/855389412510674944">April 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hamze and Kudish created a web service that delivers the recommendations to sites where the plugin is installed.

Music was particularly surprising given that he had music on at his desk pretty much all the time, and really enjoyed loading a new CD or record into the media library he had set up at home. One of the songs I remember playing for him was from a band, Manhattan Transfer, that we used to listen to a lot when I was younger and just learning about jazz, I chose¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwL9xf3YQ-4">Tuxedo Junction</a>¬†because it might cheer him up.</p>\n<p>I remember him smiling faintly. (I wish I had played him more music. I wish I had recorded more of his stories, ideally before he got sick. I wish I had figured out how to navigate the hospital and health care system better.)</p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t anticipate was how after <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/04/in-memoriam-chuck-mullenweg/">his death</a> there would be aftershocks of grief that would hit me over and over again, especially while driving or in a plane. I went from crying maybe three times in the past decade to breaking down at the end of a company town hall, when talking to family, when my Mom found out about the anniversary present my Dad had been looking at, and with any number of songs that unexpectedly took on a new meaning.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk">Wiz Khalifa &amp; Charlie Puth&#8217;s See You Again</a>, is obvious, and was in heavy rotation every¬†public place I went;¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCob76kigA">Lukas Graham&#8217;s 7 Years</a> completely broke me down when it talked about children &#8212; if I ever have any¬†my father will never meet them; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8">Kayne &amp;¬†Paul McCartney&#8217;s Only One</a>, the tribute to Kanye&#8217;s¬†daughter and passed mother and I think perhaps his best song; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA">Ed Sheeran&#8217;s Thinking Out Loud</a>, about growing old together, turning 70 as he was so close to doing; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkBKJMTCHGk">Kanye&#8217;s Ultralight Beam</a> snuck up on me, I didn&#8217;t expect it, but the questioning and gospel and anger and hope in it captured something I didn&#8217;t even realize I was feeling. Even jazz wasn&#8217;t safe, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWeXOm49kE0">Horace Silver&#8217;s lyric-less Song for My Father</a> had the same effect.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NLZCLKppZs">John Mayer&#8217;s Stop This Train</a>¬†is a song I&#8217;ve probably heard a hundred times since it came out in 2006, but all of sudden these words meant something completely different:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So scared of getting older<br />\nI&#8217;m only good at being young<br />\nSo I play the numbers game<br />\nTo find a way to say that life has just begun</p>\n<p>Had a talk with my old man<br />\nSaid, &#8220;Help me understand&#8221;<br />\nHe said, &#8220;Turn sixty-eight<br />\nYou&#8217;ll renegotiate&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I almost had to pull the car over: he was sixty-eight. What I would give for just one more conversation with him like the one the day before he passed. I wish I had written more down, recorded more of his stories, learned more about his journey.</p>\n<p>As the year has passed, the surprise crying is much less common even when one of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1211384122/playlist/3UiuLpSyYUZduDPkaaCmCA">these songs</a> comes on the radio. Usually when I think of my father it&#8217;s with a smile. I&#8217;ve even had a few treasured dreams where we&#8217;ve been able to talk, nothing that made much sense (it was a dream) but I remember waking up with an overwhelming feeling of enveloping love. While the &#8220;new normal&#8221;¬†is different, I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s better &#8212; he&#8217;s still gone.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 05:12:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"WPTavern: Embed Mastodon Statuses in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68788";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"https://wptavern.com/embed-mastodon-statuses-in-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4387:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon-logo.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/now-on-twitter-140-characters-for-your-replies" target="_blank">controversial changes to Twitter&#8217;s @reply feature</a>, which no longer counts usernames towards the 140-character limit, Mastodon registrations rose sharply. <a href="https://mastodon.social/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> is a free, open source, decentralized network that  has many similarities to Twitter. The software, named in honor of its creator&#8217;s favorite metal band, was launched in October and registered 24,000 users in the first six months. A strong negative reaction to Twitter&#8217;s changes has fueled a spike in Mastodon registrations. In the last week alone, the software&#8217;s user base has grown from 237,000 users on April 15 to <a href="https://mnm.eliotberriot.com/dashboard/db/network-drilldown?refresh=30m&orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now" target="_blank">more than 414,000 users</a> today.</p>\n<p>Mastodon is different from Twitter in that it is broken up into different independently-hosted instances. Whereas Twitter has struggled to combat trolls and abuse on its platform, Mastodon instances can each declare and enforce their own rules. For example, the flagship <a href="https://mastodon.social/about/more" target="_blank">Mastodon.social</a> instance bans content that is illegal in Germany or France, such as Nazi symbolism and Holocaust denial, excessive advertising, racism, sexism, and other undesirable posts.</p>\n<p>Mastodon&#8217;s Tweetdeck-style interface allows users to post &#8220;toots&#8221; with a 500-word character limit. Toots can also be published with a content warning so that users can choose whether to view it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With all the increased activity around Mastodon this week, there was bound to be someone with the desire to display toots on their website. The first plugin for bringing Mastodon content into WordPress has landed in the plugin directory. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-mastodon/" target="_blank">Embed Mastodon</a> was created by David Libeau, a French developer and Mastodon enthusiast. It allows users to embed toots using a shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon-embed.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I created this plugin because <a href="http://www.numerama.com/" target="_blank">Numerama</a>, a french tech website, was saying that it could be cool to embed Mastodon statuses, like with Twitter, in WordPress,&#8221; Libeau said. &#8220;I was thinking the same when I wrote a small article on my personal blog. I am using both Twitter and Mastodon but want to progressively leave Twitter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Libeau said he is not a WordPress developer and Mastodon Embed is his first plugin. He does not know if it&#8217;s coded well but said users may be interested in <a href="https://github.com/ginsterbusch/mastodon-embed" target="_blank">an alternative plugin on GitHub</a> that is a complete rewrite of his effort. The rewrite includes multiple embeds, caching, proper shortcode initialization, and fallback to &#8220;direct&#8221; embeds if embed via iframe is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Libeau said he doesn&#8217;t know what will happen to his plugin in light of the rewrite, but he is continuing to develop <a href="http://mastodon.tools/" target="_blank">small tools for Mastodon users</a>. Mastodon has an open API for apps and services, which makes it easy for developers to build things that integrate with it.</p>\n<p>After testing the Mastodon Embed plugin I found that it works but may have a couple of styling issues with the link display. If you find that it&#8217;s not working, it&#8217;s possible that your particular Mastodon instance configuration does not allow embedding via iFrame. To resolve this you may need to contact the admin of the instance or use the fork of the plugin that has a fallback for this scenario. If you find a bug with the Mastodon Embed plugin hosted on WordPress.org, you can <a href="https://github.com/DavidLibeau/mastodon-tools/issues" target="_blank">log an issue on Libeau&#8217;s Mastodon Tools repository</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 03:18:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: Headway Themes Appears to be Dying a Slow Death";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68837";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-appears-to-be-dying-a-slow-death";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9405:"<p>It&#8217;s been seven months since Grant and Clay Griffiths, founders of Headway Themes, <a href="http://headwaythemes.com/the-future-of-headway/">apologized</a> to customers for failing to communicate on a regular basis and provide adequate customer support. In the apology, the founders admit that the company was experiencing <a href="https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-confirms-financial-difficulties-issues-apology-to-customers">financial difficulties</a> and noted that competition in the WordPress drag-and-drop page-builder space was tough. The duo vowed to communicate more, provide better customer support, and continue to develop Headway 4.0. Has anything changed since the apology was published?</p>\n<h2>Headway Themes Migrates to FlyWheel Hosting</h2>\n<p>In December of 2016, <a href="https://getflywheel.com/">Flywheel</a> hosting <a href="https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic">acquired Pressmatic,</a> created by Clay Griffiths. Soon after, Headway Themes migrated to Flywheel hosting which caused a few hiccups such as site downtime due to DNS propagation, login issues, and an issue with the Headway Dashboard. The acquisition raised questions on how it would affect Clay&#8217;s ability to work on Headway.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis acquisition and employment will provide myself and my family much more stability than we‚Äôve had in a long time, and will allow me to better focus on Headway in my spare time,‚Äù Griffiths said. ‚ÄúThis includes rolling out the upcoming 4.1 release, and working hard to make sure the support and other outstanding issues are resolved for all our customers.‚Äù</p>\n<h2>Influx Confirms Communication Issues With Founders</h2>\n<p>Soon after the apology, Headway Themes began to use Influx to provide first-tier customer support. <a href="https://influx.com/">Influx</a> provides customer support for companies, including those in the WordPress ecosystem such as <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom Fields</a>. Any issues that Influx couldn&#8217;t solve are escalated to Clay and Grant. In February, Gary Bair√©ad, a former Headway Themes employee, <a href="https://twitter.com/garybairead/status/834823813674188800">contacted Headway Themes support</a> about the status of Headway 4.0 and received the following response.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Influx couldn&#8217;t answer the question because Headway developers had not informed them of its progress despite inquiring about it. Influx notes that there may be a beta released in the near future but not to be quoted on it because a similar promise was made five months prior. In January, the official <a href="https://twitter.com/headwaythemes">Headway Themes Twitter account</a> confirmed that Headway was being supported and that 4.0 would be released soon.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/3BugMedia">@3BugMedia</a> we are fully supporting Headway.  4.0 update coming soon. ^gg</p>\n<p>&mdash; Headway Themes (@headwaythemes) <a href="https://twitter.com/headwaythemes/status/816698625380286464">January 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Around the same time period, another Headway Themes customer submitted a support request asking about the status of a longstanding issue they were having. Influx explained that there was a lull because the main developers were failing to communicate. The support representative also pointed out that it seemed the only way for customers to get information about Headway Themes was by emailing support.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Influx says it tried multiple times to contact Headway Themes developers about the issue and said it was lobbying hard to get it rectified.</p>\n<h2>Payments Stop for Third-Party Block Developers</h2>\n<p>In February, Bair√©ad <a href="https://headwayupdate.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/update-4-dont-renew-3rd-party-blocks-through-headwaythemes-com/">published a request</a> to third-party block customers to not renew through Headway Themes.com and to instead, purchase and renew directly from the developer&#8217;s sites. Chris Howard, founder of <a href="http://pizazzwp.com/">Pizazz WP,</a> and Chris Rault, co-founder of <a href="https://www.headwayrocket.com/">HeadwayRocket,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HeadwayRocket/status/826005360834142208">confirmed</a> they are owed money from customers who purchased and renewed blocks through Headway Themes.com.</p>\n<p>I reached out to both developers to see if they&#8217;ve been paid since February.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent Clay a bunch of messages, but he&#8217;s completely ignoring me and hasn&#8217;t paid over another cent since the last long delay,&#8221; Rault said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs down to only 2 or 3 renewals a month, but I‚Äôm not receiving anything still. I&#8217;d estimate they still owe me around $2,000,&#8221; Howard said.</p>\n<p>For Howard, the issue of not receiving payments has been <a href="https://wptavern.com/headway-3-8-9-patches-potential-xss-vulnerability#comment-200810">going on for months</a>.</p>\n<h2>Former Support Staff Still Owed Money</h2>\n<p>Headway Themes&#8217; apology does not mention the former support team who the company <a href="https://wptavern.com/former-headway-themes-employee-goes-public-staff-has-not-been-paid-and-customers-are-not-receiving-support">failed to pay</a> on time for months. Since the apology, members of the team have received small payments but are still owed thousands of dollars. Receiving payments from Headway Themes is often a difficult process.</p>\n<p>After not receiving a payment in February, a former team member sent a flurry of emails to Grant and Clay Griffiths inquiring about the payment. Clay eventually responded that they would send out payments when they&#8217;re able too. After a week of questioning when that would be with no response, the team member received a payment.</p>\n<h2>Influx Says Headway Themes is Restructuring</h2>\n<p>A Headway Themes customer recently contacted support to ask about the status of Headway and published Influx&#8217;s response to the company&#8217;s support forums. Here&#8217;s their response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi [Redacted],</p>\n<p>Thanks for reaching out.</p>\n<p>Currently, Headway is going through a restructuring phase to resolve the challenges being faced at this time. We do not have the full details here at support but the main stakeholders are working to return Headway to its rightful mode of operations.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if there are any more questions that I can answer for you. Kind Regards.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To learn more about the restructuring process and what&#8217;s going on with Headway development, I reached out to Grant and Clay Griffiths. Both have not responded to my request for comment.</p>\n<h2>Blox Picks Up Where Headway Left Off</h2>\n<p>Last year, when it appeared the future of Headway Themes <a href="https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-future-is-uncertain-amidst-financial-troubles">was in jeopardy</a>, Maarten Schraven forked the <a href="http://bloxthemebuilder.com/start-downloading-beta-blox-theme-v1-0-0/">Headway 3.8.8 codebase</a> and named it <a href="http://bloxthemebuilder.com/">Blox Builder</a>. Blox Builder is 100% GPL Licensed and is a direct replacement for Headway. Schraven recently <a href="http://bloxtheme.com/lots-of-questions-about-blox-theme/">answered a number of questions</a> related to the project, one of which is how easy is it to transfer from Headway to Blox.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are different ways to convert your Headway Theme to Blox Theme. The best way is to export your template, you get an .json file. In this file you have to change hw to bt and headway to blox. If you have a large website you also can change the database tables. Some of our users have Blox Theme and Headway Themes side by side and switch between them. The last way (not yet available) is our conversion script. This script can do two things, change the database or do the same search and replace. This script will work automatic or as standalone.</p>\n<p>Or, if you think this is to difficult, you always can ask us for the conversion, we can discuss this on e-mail or skype</p></blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s no time frame on when the conversion script will be available. If you&#8217;re a fan of the way Headway Themes works and are looking for a similar replacement, check out Blox Builder.</p>\n<h2>Many in the Headway Themes Community Have Moved On</h2>\n<p>A number of devoted fans and customers of Headway have switched to other page builders like Divi, Elementor, and Beaver Builder. What was once a vibrant community-run Slack channel for Headway Themes enthusiasts has turned into a ghost town. There is little hope among them that the company will be able to rebound.</p>\n<h2>Not Much Has Changed</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the issues that prompted Headway Themes&#8217; founders to issue an apology are still present. There is a lack of communication on the company&#8217;s blog, social media accounts, and to Influx, the company it has outsourced customer support to. The apology dated Sept 13, 2016, was the last post published to the company&#8217;s blog. Former employees and third-party developers are still owed considerable amounts of money and there has been little if any development on the Headway code base.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 02:00:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: HeroPress Partners With WPShout to Offer WordPress Education Scholarships";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69027";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/heropress-partners-with-wpshout-to-offer-wordpress-education-scholarships";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3468:"<p>HeroPress has teamed up with <a href="https://alexdenning.com/">Alex Denning</a>, <a href="https://pressupinc.com/">Fred Meyer, and David Hayes</a> of <a href="https://wpshout.com/">WPShout</a> to offer 10 copies of <a href="https://wpshout.com/up-and-running/">Up and Running Second Edition</a> at the deluxe tier.

The name is a combination of the words checkout and decathlon, according to its creator <a href="https://foxland.fi/" target="_blank">Sami Keijonen</a>.</p>\n<p>Checathlon combines elegant typography with a bold, pink accent color to showcase products and services on a business or e-commerce website. The theme was designed by Finnish designer Toni Suni and is Keijonen&#8217;s 13th theme to be listed in the directory.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-screenshot.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I had some kind of vision of what I wanted and Toni created a pixel perfect design based on our discussion,&#8221; Keijonen said. &#8220;I‚Äôm super happy about the end result. Unfortunately, the design and the theme was not good enough for WordPress.com and the theme was rejected from there.&#8221; Keijonen opted to create a Checathlon Plus plugin as an alternative way to monetize the theme.</p>\n<p>Checathlon has an intuitive way of organizing the content featured on the front page. Unlike many other themes, the front page is not controlled by a custom page template. Once you set the front page as a static page, the Customizer will give access to the service/pricing, products, testimonial, and blog sections.</p>\n<p>The theme includes support for a Pricing page template and a Team Page template. These features make Checathlon more flexible for use on a business, agency, non-profit, or e-commerce website.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-team-page.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The pricing template has a &#8220;Service and Pricing widget&#8221; area where users can drop in the custom widgets available in the Checathlon Plus plugin. The widgets make it easy for users to set an icon, title, content, price, and a link for each pricing tier, as well as the ability to highlight one tier as featured.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-pricing-template.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Checathlon was built to support several plugins, including <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/" target="_blank">Custom Content Portfolio</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> (testimonials and portfolio). The theme includes styles for the Jetpack email subscription widget and EDD <a href="https://foxland.fi/demo/checathlon/downloads/" target="_blank">downloads</a> and account pages. It&#8217;s also tagged as <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready</a>, which means that it has successfully passed an accessibility audit. Check out the <a href="https://foxland.fi/demo/checathlon/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see Checathlon in action.</p>\n<p>Keijonen is taking a unique approach by creating a <a href="https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon-plus/" target="_blank">Checathlon Plus plugin</a> as an alternative to offering a &#8220;pro version&#8221; of the theme. It extends the theme to include more customizer capabilities, additional widgets, cart customization features for EDD, and two child themes. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/checathlon/" target="_blank">free theme</a> is available on WordPress.org and <a href="https://foxland.fi/documents/for/checathlon/" target="_blank">documentation</a> can be found on the theme&#8217;s website.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:25:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Restores Tabbed Interface";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69139";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-tabbed-interface";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4036:"<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tabs.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/CCRDK5WZEM">Jeffrey Betts</a>\n<p>Last month the WordPress Plugin Directory <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm" target="_blank">relaunched with a new design</a> and improvements to the search algorithm. The new design replaced the plugin pages&#8217; previous tabbed interface with a wall of text, truncated by numerous &#8220;read more&#8221; links.</p>\n<p>The outpouring of negative community feedback on the new design overshadowed many of the helpful improvements. Removal of the tabs was by far the most unpopular design choice in this iteration, as many found it to be confusing and inferior in terms of navigating the information efficiently. Users, developers, and contributors on the redesign <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored" target="_blank">felt their feedback was roundly ignored</a> throughout all phases of the design&#8217;s beta and testing period.</p>\n<p>Four months ago, contributor Jon Ang (@kenshino) opened a <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2328" target="_blank">ticket</a> regarding the &#8220;read more&#8221; links, which he described as &#8220;a usability nightmare.&#8221; The ticket was closed as a duplicate of <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278" target="_blank">another ticket</a> which received very little discussion. Today, Otto marked the ticket as fixed, <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5399" target="_blank">announcing the return of tabs</a> in the commit message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Change single-plugin view to have tabbed design. Eliminates read-more on all sections except developers and changelog, adds tabs back to interface using CSS to switch between them. Tabs control both main display as well as widgets.</p>\n<p>Known issues: Changelog read-more not working (js issue), developers section is currently split using CSS, future change will split this section into two separate sections.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Members of the Advanced WordPress Facebook (AWP) community, who were among the most critical of the new design, are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1473163646079178/" target="_blank">pleased with the change</a>. The new tabs are subtle, tasteful, and in line with the overall design. They eliminate the clutter that the expanded &#8220;read more&#8221; links created.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/plugin-page-tabs-restored.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Reviews tab now displays six of the most recent reviews, as opposed the the previous two most recent. This makes it not as easy to destroy a plugin&#8217;s reputation with poor reviews timed to always be visible on the main plugin page. Otto <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1473163646079178/?comment_id=1473175582744651&reply_comment_id=1473218756073667&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R3%22%7D" target="_blank">replied</a> to comments on the AWP community, saying that these numbers are not set in stone and that there are good arguments for displaying different sets of reviews, as opposed to simply the most recent ones.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago the meta team <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-stats-and-links-to-older-versions-of-plugins" target="_blank">brought back stats and older versions of plugins</a>, a couple of features that were removed in the first iteration of the new directory. Screenshot display is still somewhat clunky, requiring users to click on their browsers&#8217; back button in order to return to the plugin details. Future iterations of the design are expected to address the remaining quirks and issues that users and contributors have raised since the relaunch.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 21:46:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7.4 Fixes 47 Issues";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69141";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-4-fixes-visual-editor-incompatibility-with-upcoming-version-of-chrome";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1182:"<p>WordPress 4.7.4 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/04/wordpress-4-7-4/">is available</a> and is a maintenance release that fixes¬†47 issues reported against 4.7.¬†This update includes a visual editor¬†<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40305">compatibility fix</a> for an upcoming version of Chrome.</p>\n<p>Uploading¬†video and audio files no longer result in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40075">broken thumbnails</a>¬†and the REST API received a few enhancements related to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39854">data</a> <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40136">handling</a>.

It actually went live two weeks ago, but I wanted to give it time to work out any kinks before broadly promoting it.</p>\n<p>Now, I think we&#8217;re ready for prime time. So, why do we need another place to list WordPress jobs?</p>\n<p>The signal to noise ratio &#8212; both for employers seeking qualified candidates, and for candidates finding quality job listings &#8212; is pretty low across the board in the job market. Most people who hire technical professionals will tell you that it&#8217;s very difficult to find good candidates. And anyone seeking great job opportunities knows how hard it can be to find out the best opportunities, especially at the times you&#8217;re actually looking.</p>\n<p>The goal for the Post Status WordPress job board is to take advantage of both sides of this equation.</p>\n<p>Post Status isn&#8217;t a huge website with tons of traffic. But the traffic I do get is from a highly targeted audience of primarily WordPress professionals, or web professionals who use WordPress as a primary tool.</p>\n<p>By creating a highly targeted job board, I&#8217;m able to increase the signal on both sides; employers can get quality applications, and applicants can find quality employers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our team &#8212; meaning <a href="https://poststatus.com/profiles/katie-richards/">Katie Richards</a>, and myself &#8212; go through each employer&#8217;s listing to confirm that it&#8217;s a qualified listing of someone actually hiring, provides relevant information, and is properly described for the available position.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already got 20+ jobs and counting, and I know many of them have had applications start to roll in, even without public announcement yet.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to submit a job, the process is currently only for Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/club">members</a>. We may open that up in the coming weeks, but for now, you can join and post, or if someone from your organization is a member, they can post it.</p>\n<p>Listings last for 45 days (the first listings are being extended out starting today), and will be marketed to the Post Status Club &#8212; now over 900 WordPress professionals &#8212; as well as the free Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>, where we&#8217;ll send digests of new jobs.</p>\n<p>In the future, we may create new features for job seekers to keep an even closer eye on available jobs, but for now, the email and listing page are the place to go. And we may build new tools for employers as we get feedback and see demand for them.</p>\n<p>I look forward to this being a valuable resource for the WordPress community. We&#8217;re dedicated to making it work well for a long haul, and we expect general activity to increase as the word gets out that it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t mind, we&#8217;d love your help to promote this job board, both now and when you hear of companies hiring and people seeking positions. It is a truly great feeling to know that you helped someone find their next workplace.</p>\n<p>So, check out some <a href="https://poststatus.com/jobs">WordPress jobs</a>!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:35:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2017 Announces Speakers, Opens Registration for Contributor Day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=69083";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-announces-speakers-opens-registration-for-contributor-day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2015:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wordcamp-europe-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> has been rolling out <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/speakers/" target="_blank">speaker</a> announcements over the past week, slowly building what appears to be a strong lineup of both European and international WordPress experts.

This year the survey received feedback from 302 respondents in 61 different countries, a 43% increase in responses from 2015. The top five countries represented in the survey include the United States (27.15%), India (7.62%), United Kingdom (6.95%), Germany (6.29%), and Canada (3.64%). English remains the most popular language for BuddyPress sites at nearly 70% and this year Spanish (10.7%) replaced French for the #2 spot, followed by German (9.96%).</p>\n<p>A new question in the 2016 survey asked users what PHP versions their sites are on. More than 53% of respondents report having sites on PHP 7.0+ and 63% are using a version higher than 5.6+.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/buddypress-php-2016.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Lead developer Paul Gibbs sees these results as an affirmation that the BuddyPress core leadership made the right decision when dropping support for PHP 5.2 nine months ago.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We (<a href="https://twitter.com/buddypress">@buddypress</a>) made the right call 9 months ago to drop support for PHP 5.2 in our last major release.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Paul Gibbs (@pgibbs) <a href="https://twitter.com/pgibbs/status/849399725707202562">April 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In fact, our 2016 users survey <a href="https://t.co/1LClEoOr38">https://t.co/1LClEoOr38</a> suggests 88% of respondents use PHP &gt;5.6, maybe we can be more aggressive this year.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Paul Gibbs (@pgibbs) <a href="https://twitter.com/pgibbs/status/849399973649276931">April 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gibbs is currently on a sabbatical from BuddyPress and was not available for comment. Project lead John James Jacoby said that the decision to drop support for PHP 5.2 may not be a direct corollary to its usage falling below 1%, but the core team will continue to bump the minimum version in the future with consideration for user happiness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs hard to know whether increasing our minimum PHP version made any direct difference,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My hunch is most users do not care very much, and the ones that do, care greatly. It‚Äôs all about keeping users happy ‚Äì sometimes that means maintaining compatibility with old dependencies; other times it means kindly motivating users to upgrade things maybe they haven‚Äôt thought about in a while.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 2016 results show that 45% of respondents have been using BuddyPress for a year or less. While this isn&#8217;t necessarily an indication of users&#8217; ability, it is interesting in light of the project&#8217;s recent shift to focus on developers and site builders. The survey results indicate that more users identify themselves as a beginner when it comes to knowledge of BuddyPress themes and hooks.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/buddypress-knowledge.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress core developers made the decision to focus on site builders and developers based on how they saw the project&#8217;s user base changing over time. Making the software 100% turnkey is no longer one of their chief objectives.

It can be¬†a top-level menu item or tucked away in a sub-menu.¬†Sometimes,¬†the plugin doesn&#8217;t warrant a settings link.</p>\n<p>A new plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-plugin-menu-items-on-activation/">Show Plugin Menu Items on Activation</a> created by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kellenmace">Kellen Mace</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/binarygary">Gary Kovar</a> seeks to calm the chaos.¬†When a plugin is activated, an Admin Notice is displayed that informs the user where to configure it.</p>\n<img />Where to Find Akismet&#8217;s Settings\n<p>The notice can be dismissed by either clicking the dismiss button or hovering over the menu location. The notice does not display for plugins¬†that¬†include a welcome page¬†or wizard such as BuddyPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>The number of admin pointers that are¬†displayed depends on the number of menu items that are added. For example, if a plugin adds three menu items, three admin pointers are displayed.</p>\n<p>When four or more menu items are added, a notice is shown at the top of the screen that says, &#8216;Many new plugin menu items were added.&#8217;¬†If no menu items are¬†added, a notice displays at the top of the screen that says, &#8216;No new plugin menu items were added.&#8217;</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.7.3 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues.¬†Although plugins ought to make finding the settings link easier upon activation, this particular plugin has me¬†wondering if displaying these types of admin notices should be a core feature. In my experience, plugin authors rarely take advantage of admin pointers to explain where to go or what to do next after being activated.</p>\n<p>Related to the above, I encourage plugin developers to <a href="https://hugh.blog/2012/07/27/wordpress-add-plugin-settings-link-to-plugins-page/">read this article </a>by Hugh Lashbrooke, that explains how to add a settings link to the plugins listing page.

To be honest, I was not one of the children or teenagers who knew what they wanted to become when they grow up. And to stay honest, I still don‚Äôt know exactly to this day.</p>\n<p>After school I got advised to start working for the government; jobs are well paid and stressless. But considering my tasks, I did not have the feeling that there was any particular skill or performance needed to get them done, nor was there any desirable achievement in the years to come.</p>\n<p>In the following 12 years, I switched administrations and ministries, trying to find more fulfillment and happiness in what I was doing during the day. But sooner or later the daily routine made me feel very miserable and frustrated. I started to realize that though I still did not know what I wanted to become, I knew exactly what I did not want to do anymore: sitting in an office from nine to five, doing the same administrative work, day after day, without any motivation, without any personal goal. There must be more in life for me!?</p>\n<p>My husband, <a href="https://twitter.com/schlessera">Alain Schlesser</a>, at that point also a government agent, was fed up as well and decided to quit his job and start freelancing as a web developer focussing on WordPress &#8211; so at least one of us had a specific goal.</p>\n<h3>Getting Out</h3>\n<p>In summer of 2014 I opted for a four year sabbatical, we sold everything we owned in Luxembourg and moved to the German ‚ÄúEifel‚Äù quite into the middle of nowhere together with our three french bulldogs Jasper, Duke, and Indra. I did not have the slightest idea of where my personal journey would lead me in the end, but I had the feeling that it was time to take better care of myself.</p>\n<p>First, I started studies as a dog health &amp; behavior trainer, which I completed successfully. After the studies, I got sick and depressed. I gained more and more weight, was constantly dealing with all sorts of aches and had severe doubts about what the future might bring to me. And the more I doubted, the less productive I got.</p>\n<p>In summer of 2015 I got the diagnosis that I was suffering from lipedema &#8211; a chronically progressive disease which is basically a very painful fat disorder, that almost exclusively affects women. I decided to completely change my life and focus on my mental and physical health.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, my husband was working hard to achieve his personal goals. At that point I did not have a very clear idea of what he was actually doing during the day, nor was I interested in any details.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had nothing to do with the web or computers in general, except for Google, Facebook and writing emails.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Coding, programming, developing, those were foreign words to me. A few years back, I had started two blogs on wordpress.com where I shared my dogs‚Äô stories and my experiences during my studies &#8211; that was the only knowledge I had about Alain‚Äôs new world &#8211; and about WordPress. Today I agree that these were hard times for us: we spent 24 hours together in the same house but we did not have much to share anymore: I had locked myself out of the life my husband was leading during the day due to a lack of interest and knowledge on one side, and fears on the other.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>I entered the world of WordPress because Alain invited me to join him in a trip to WordCamp Europe 2016 in Vienna. Despite looking forward to exploring a new city and do some shopping, I had no expectations of what I was going to experience in Vienna. To be honest, ¬†I was scared of meeting the &#8220;nerdy&#8221; part of my husband&#8217;s life and of not being able to get involved in it &#8211; again. However, what happened in Vienna was totally unexpected and overwhelming for me: I met hundreds of open-minded, interesting, welcoming, friendly and helpful people who were interested in what I had to share with them, although I was not involved at all in WordPress or the community so far.</p>\n<p>I probably had the most inspiring discussions I‚Äôve ever had in my life and one of the funniest and joyful weeks too. There were more than two thousand people, and nobody (!) made me feel uncomfortable, ignorant or out of place.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have never experienced such an unconditionally welcoming atmosphere before &#8211; and I noticed that I truly wanted to be a part of that amazing community in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To be honest, I actually had withdrawal symptoms once we were back home. I got very active in following up and my Twitter account, which I had registered years ago without ever having tweeted before, suddenly got filled up with WordPress people.</p>\n<h3>Diving Deeper</h3>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8361-min.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1705" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8361-min-300x300.jpg" alt="Carole, Alain, and dogs" width="300" height="300" /></a>Only a few days after being back in Germany I started to organize trips to other WordCamps, and in September of 2016 Alain and I traveled together with our three dogs to <a href="https://2016.frankfurt.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Frankfurt</a> (Germany) &#8211; both of us as volunteers, and Alain as a speaker too.</p>\n<p>Volunteering felt excellent and right, and we got in touch with the German WordPress Community for the first time. Alain‚Äôs talk was a success, and the German community adopted our entire family immediately; we loved seeing our dogs getting spoiled with hugs and treats.</p>\n<p>In October of 2016 we joined <a href="https://2016.netherlands.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Netherlands</a> in Utrecht where we once again met interesting and friendly people. Another premiere for me: ‚ÄúHow WordPress Saved My Life‚Äù by <a href="https://twitter.com/WordNerdSally">Sally Mayor</a> was the first talk I ever chose to see at a WordCamp. As you can imagine by reading the title, this was totally inspiring to me.</p>\n<p>Just as with the previous WordCamps, Alain and I hardly spent any time on our own: hospitable organizers, volunteers, speakers, and attendees surrounded us and insisted on showing us the best spots and restaurants in town.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, we visited <a href="https://2016.cologne.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Cologne</a> (Germany) where we looked forward to seeing some of the lovely people we met two months before at WordCamp Frankfurt. I helped out at the registration desk, as I did in Frankfurt &#8211; definitely one of the best opportunities to get in touch with the community.</p>\n<p>At that point, I also took part in my first ‚ÄúContributor Day‚Äù. I participated in the Polyglots team as well as in the Community team, as these don‚Äôt require technical knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the day, I had localized one free theme into German (which was committed the same day) and joined the discussions for organizing a new type of WordCamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I was more interested in contributing to the community part, I joined Slack and was again diligent in following up. I wanted to become an active part of this community and help create and maintain the welcoming atmosphere I have experienced myself. It worked out very well: I am now a member of the organizing team for a very special German WordCamp with a unique and new concept, to happen in 2018.</p>\n<h3>New Wapuu</h3>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collage-min.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1707" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collage-min-300x226.jpg" alt="Wabully with a real French Bulldog" width="300" height="226" /></a>Another idea was born at WordCamp Cologne: designing a Wapuu with the characteristics of a french bulldog. Meanwhile, our dogs had become an integral part of the German community, who considers our frenchies as the unofficial mascots. Said and done &#8211; by channeling designer skills that I did not even know about, I created the <a href="https://wapu.us/wapuu/wabully/">‚ÄúWabully‚Äù</a>. Jasper, our nine-year-old male frenchie was the template.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control of Life</h3>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/before_after-min.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1708" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/before_after-min-203x300.jpg" alt="Before and after a health change" width="203" height="300" /></a>Besides all the positive and inspiring input for my brain, I took good care of my physical health too. I continued losing weight due to healthy and fresh nutrition, and my fitness level increased because I was doing sports again. My lipedema therapy &#8211; including two surgeries &#8211; was very successful and so my physical and mental health got better and better. In 18 months I managed to lose almost seventy pounds. I was actively taking control of my life again.</p>\n<p>In November of 2016 Alain and I joined our first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Koln/">WordPress Meetup in Cologne</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/ocean90">Dominik Schilling</a> was sharing his experience during his WordPress 4.6 release lead. I noticed that all this ‚ÄúWordPress-stuff‚Äù was not so strange to me anymore; I managed to follow most of Dominik‚Äôs testimonies &#8211; and it was interesting to me through the entire talk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I realized that WordPress was not a mystery to me anymore and that discussions at home must have changed a lot in the past months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now I knew the people Alain was talking about, I understood most of the projects and concepts he was referring to, and I was not bored anymore when he was talking about his current development issues.</p>\n<p>I encouraged Alain to book a trip to Philadelphia in December of 2016 to attend <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> &#8211; an amazing, precious and fruitful experience for him. Unfortunately, I could not join him because of surgery. I admit that I was a bit jealous at that point, but I (rightfully) had a hunch that this trip could be important for my husband and his professional future.</p>\n<p>By coincidence, the only talk I saw online at WordCamp US was <a href="https://twitter.com/topher1kenobe">Topher DeRosia‚Äôs</a> presentation of ‚ÄúHeroPress &#8211; The People of WordPress‚Äù which was totally inspiring to me. At that point, I would never have imagined that a few weeks later he‚Äôd find me and ask me to write an essay for HeroPress&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Using My Powers For Good</h3>\n<p>Earlier that year in spring, I had created a Facebook group for lipedema affected women in Luxembourg together with a friend. Lipedema is largely unknown in Luxembourg and often misdiagnosed as simple obesity. There is almost no help for affected women in my country of birth. I was indeed very lucky having moved to Germany, where the specialists in lipedema diagnosis and treatment are located; otherwise, I would probably not have been diagnosed and treated correctly up until now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Inspired by my personal success and the growth of our Facebook group I decided, in January of 2017, to fight for a change in Luxembourg together with other lipedema patients.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have been very active in educational work and we built a significant presence in Luxembourgish media in the past few weeks. The feedback was enormous and we founded a nonprofit association. I knew it would be very useful to create a website to reach more affected women, doctors, and other interested people.</p>\n<p>I accepted the challenge and decided to set up a WordPress site. Alain built a theme according to my ideas and I successfully completed my very first plugin installations &#8211; most importantly for me a page builder called Beaver Builder. I had never imagined how easy, fun and fulfilling building of a website could be! With almost no skills and within a period of seven days only I managed to create lots of valuable content with a nice structure. I admit that living under the same roof with a devoted and passionate developer made some things easier for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But besides that, I began to understand what makes WordPress so special: everybody who has something to share is given the possibility to do so by WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If I managed to do that, why wouldn‚Äôt you? There are plenty of possibilities to help you build your website, blog or business &#8211; use them! And many fantastic WordPress people offer their support, contribute every single day to improve the software and to make it accessible for everybody out there. And some specialists offer great courses for absolute beginners like I am, to help them improving their skills.</p>\n<p>We have reached many lipedema patients through my website ‚Äú<a href="https://www.lipoedem.lu/">Lip√∂dem L√´tzebuerg</a>‚Äù, who thank us every day for our commitment as so-called lipedema fighters. I am so happy that lipedema is now a topic of discussion in Luxembourg, which is not only a consequence of our devotion but also due to WordPress allowing me to build a website in a very short amount of time, and with almost no skills. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the National Patients Representation, we have formulated concrete demands concerning diagnosis and therapy to the Luxembourgish Government.</p>\n<p>I am overwhelmed and happy to see how much attention and gratefulness my work and website have earned. It fulfills me in a way that I had not experienced in the past 12 years during my well-paid job.</p>\n<h3>Making a Living</h3>\n<p>It turned out that my enthusiasm and content writing skills were noticed by the CEO of a startup in Luxembourg. I got a remote job offer for writing and managing content on their WordPress website and for being a part of the social media team. We are currently testing a possible cooperation, and I have already been writing some of the content for their website.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I got contacted to work on the elaboration and social media spreading processes of an important lipedema study in Germany as well.</p>\n<p>I was not even actively searching for a job and the offers come rolling in nevertheless &#8211; what an amazing new experience!</p>\n<p>At the same time, I was busy in the last months for the WordPress community:</p>\n<p>As member of an organizing team, I was in charge of finding the perfect location for a WordCamp in 2018. Together with some of my colleagues I have visited some excellent sites in Germany, and I am leading the negotiations.</p>\n<p>Alain and I joined the first German contributor night in Cologne, which was both productive and fun. I proudly presented my very first results of crocheting, which I started in-between my surgeries as a pastime while I needed to stay in bed:</p>\n<table border="0" width="100%">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align="center" width="50%"><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8774-min.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1709" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8774-min-300x300.jpg" alt="Small yellow crocheted wapuu" width="300" height="300" /></a></td>\n<td align="center" width="50%"><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9310-min.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1710" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9310-min-300x300.jpg" alt="Crocheted Wabully" width="300" height="300" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span>In February of 2017 Alain and I have been asked </span><span>by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BirgitOlzem"><span>Birgit Olzem</span></a><span> to be part of the organizing team of the </span><a href="http://www.wpmeetup-eifel.de/"><span>WordPress Meetup Eifel</span></a><span>, which we </span><span>both were delighted to accept</span><span>. </span><span>The first Meetup organized by the new team of three will happen at the end of April.</span></p>\n<p>In March of 2017 we flew to <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp London</a>. We were both volunteering and I feel honored that I was part of an outstanding team which made every possible effort to organize a welcoming and amazing event for every single attendee. In terms of inclusivity and accessibility, WordCamp London set high standards: there has been a lactation room, a cr√®che, a multi-faith room, a quiet room, live transcription of the talks, life essential boxes in women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs restrooms. Almost every area was accessible to wheelchairs &#8211; with volunteers designated to help in the few spots that weren‚Äôt. We had a lovely and inspiring time there and I have yet to follow up with everyone. It makes me feel like my family grows with every WordCamp.</p>\n<p>Last but not least I want to share that I submitted a lightning talk proposal to <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> in Paris. It took all of my courage, but I was feeling so honored and inspired by Topher&#8217;s request to write an essay for HeroPress that I realized there might be a story which deserves to be told. I was so proud to have applied as a speaker that it wouldn&#8217;t even matter in the end whether my talk is accepted or not.</p>\n<p>Alain has applied as speaker as well, and we will both help as volunteers again. I can‚Äôt wait to be part of this big event. I look forward to seeing friends and meeting new people. It will be my one-year anniversary of being part of the WordPress community &#8211; a year with lots of positive changes and inspiration.</p>\n<p><span>In the end, my talk proposal for WordCamp Europe has not been selected. Of course, I felt a bit sad about this. Even if I was aware that there had been over 300 applications for more or less 40 spots, I had some kind of feeling of having ‚Äúfailed‚Äù on my first try‚Ä¶ But after having slept on it, I soon got over my deception and I was pleased for Alain for having reached a milestone: his talk proposal got accepted.</span></p>\n<p><span>And most importantly, I decided not to let this discourage me from applying as a speaker again. There are other WordCamps and all things happen for a good reason: I was pondering for weeks if I should attend </span><a href="https://2017.berlin.wordcamp.org/"><b>WordCamp Berlin</b></a><span> or not. I love the community, I love the city but Alain already had other plans. Said and done &#8211; I booked a hotel, bought my ticket, applied as a volunteer and submitted my talk proposal, slightly modified and in German. This time my lightning talk got accepted and I will be a speaker for the very first time at WordCamp Berlin on the 13th of May &#8211; I am more than excited about it. Alain‚Äôs plans were changing so that he‚Äôs now able to join me with our dogs on my trip to Berlin.</span></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for joining me in the more "nerdy" part of my life, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaroleOlinger">@CaroleOlinger</a> ! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCFRA?src=hash">#WCFRA</a> <a href="https://t.co/VuTHtW3EkP">pic.twitter.com/VuTHtW3EkP</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Alain Schlesser (@schlessera) <a href="https://twitter.com/schlessera/status/772411090672156672">September 4, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope that I can give something back to the WordPress community with what I‚Äôm doing.

WordPress gives you the opportunity to be whoever you want to be and to give yourself a voice.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Is For You, No Matter Who You Are</h3>\n<p>Furthermore I would love to see every WordPress user, blogger, developer, programmer, designer &#8211; and even more so their respective partners &#8211; joining the nearest WordCamp (or Meetup) and meeting the amazing WordPress community! Especially when you haven‚Äôt done this so far. You‚Äôll be able to find inspiration and friends, develop unknown personal skills, gain new perspectives on your job or life and, in any case, learn a lot, just like I did. And last but not least &#8211; it can even bring your relationship to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>I still have no idea where my personal journey will lead me in the end but I have this growing feeling that WordPress could be an integral part of my life. Fortunately, it is already a part of me.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: The Only Journey Is The One Within" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Only%20Journey%20Is%20The%20One%20Within&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: The Only Journey Is The One Within" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F&title=The+Only+Journey+Is+The+One+Within" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: The Only Journey Is The One Within"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/041917-min-150x150.jpg&description=The Only Journey Is The One Within" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: The Only Journey Is The One Within"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/" title="The Only Journey Is The One Within"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/">The Only Journey Is The One Within</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 05:00:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Carole Olinger";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: Open Collective is a New, Transparent Way to Fund Open Source Projects";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68528";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"https://wptavern.com/open-collective-is-a-new-transparent-way-to-fund-open-source-projects";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8728:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/open-collective.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://opencollective.com" target="_blank">Open Collective</a> is a new service that aims to make it easy for individuals, groups, and organizations to raise money in a transparent way. Although many projects have communities ready to offer financial support, the paperwork, taxes, and accounting involved in collecting money under the proper legal entity can be a nearly insurmountable hurdle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So far, the Internet has been very good at helping people do things together,&#8221; Open Collective co-founder Xavier Damman said. &#8220;But once it involves money, there is no good solution. Creating a new legal entity is too much overhead, too early. What if we could create a virtual entity that can collect money as easily as creating a Facebook Group?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective was created to eliminate the need for setting up a legal entity in order to raise funds. Groups can set up a collective and begin managing their funds immediately. The two key differentiators of the platform are the ability to raise money recurrently and the built-in transparency. Members of the collective must approve or reject an expense before the money can be used. Unpaid expenses and available funds can be viewed by the public.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ledger-screen.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Open Collective currently has 228 active collectives and <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource" target="_blank">196 of them are open source projects</a>. Many open source maintainers are finding success raising funds on the platform. <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, a popular utility for bundling JavaScript files, is one of the most prominent successes, having <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack" target="_blank">funded its first full-time developer</a> through the platform.

In a recent <a href="https://medium.com/open-collective/why-and-how-to-fund-the-open-source-projects-you-depend-on-da62a582307" target="_blank">interview with Open Collective</a>, Miller said he enjoyed his day job and didn&#8217;t want to leave it to set up &#8220;Preact Inc.&#8221; One of the reasons he chose the platform was to leave room for future key maintainers to be able to access the community&#8217;s resources, instead of cannibalizing them all in his own personal fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you‚Äôre fundraising for a community, there‚Äôs a clear implication that it‚Äôs for the betterment of the project as a whole,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;By putting the project at center stage, as opposed to a person, there‚Äôs no need to explain that. In our case, I think it‚Äôs why people were so willing to contribute.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The structure that Open Collective provides puts the focus on the community, instead of solely focusing on funding the talents and efforts of the most prominent maintainer. It also gives projects the opportunity to distribute funds to different types of contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My advice would be to put channels in place for all the different kinds of support an open source project needs, and offer people clear options: write features, raise issues, make a pull request, do code reviews, give money,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Don‚Äôt try to hide the fact that the project needs funding, and don‚Äôt skirt around that fact that it‚Äôs specifically about money, or it will come off as disingenuous. If there‚Äôs something users want from the project that money can enable, give them an avenue to make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective has helped raise more than $200,000 for open source projects on the platform to date. Projects like MochaJS, Babel, GulpJS, Vapor, Qubes OS, and Hoodie have raised thousands of dollars for ongoing maintenance and support. Many of these projects are critical to the open source ecosystem and strapped for resources.</p>\n<p>Although the platform is currently dominated by open source software projects, Open Collective was built to be capable of funding many different types of group efforts. Co-founder Xavier Damman described the platform&#8217;s goals in an <a href="http://dataconomy.com/2016/12/xavier-damman-open-collective/" target="_blank">interview with Dataconomy</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal as Open Collective is to create this new light type of association for our generation who really love doing those side projects, creating those meetup groups, taking the initiative to create a conference located in your city, do open source projects together, create movements like occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, all of that. There‚Äôs a whole bunch of things that our generation is doing but we don‚Äôt have any platform to enable those movements and these communities to collect money. So it‚Äôs all about finding a new way, fund those communities that can have a larger impact.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Open Collective&#8217;s co-founders share a strong commitment to open source and the majority of the platform&#8217;s code is MIT-licensed and <a href="https://github.com/opencollective" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm a big fan of open source myself and we open source everything,&#8221; Damman said. &#8220;Open Collective is an open source platform because we believe in open source. We believe it‚Äôs the future of work. There‚Äôs no reason for having two different engineers in two different parts of the world solving the same problem. And also open source is the right business decision. I‚Äôm an engineer, as well as a developer, and we tend to make much better code if we know that other people can look at it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective takes 10% of funds raised by a collective in addition to credit card fees, which are estimated at 3% + $0.30/transaction). The platform&#8217;s fee structure is slightly higher when compared to other crowd-funding and fundraising platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which charge a 5% fee for successfully funded projects and 3-5% for credit card processing. However, these platforms are more goal-based and not necessarily designed for generating recurring funding. Open Collective&#8217;s fees include use of the platform for managing bookkeeping, taxes, and reimbursing expenses.</p>\n<p>Open Collective for organizations is currently in private beta. It allows local chapters and other organizations to raise money and manage funds without having to open a separate bank account. <a href="https://opencollective.com/wwcode" target="_blank">Women Who Code</a> is an organization that is using the platform this way and has an annual budget of $171,978 based on current recurring donations.</p>\n<p>Money issues can be the source of bitter disputes in communities, especially when maintainers are short on time and neglect to document how donated funds are being used. Open Collective&#8217;s approach to financial transparency is sorely missing in most fundraising platforms, which don&#8217;t require their users to account for how the money has been spent after it is donated. Its built-in transparency and accountability mirrors the values of many open source projects and gives communities a healthy and convenient way to monitor the distribution of funds.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:55:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Automattic to Close San Francisco Office";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68827";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-close-san-francisco-office";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3760:"<p>Automattic&#8217;s San Francisco, CA office is located at¬†140 Hawthorne.

The event will bring together design and technology experts who will discuss solutions for the ways that digital products and services exclude people.</p>\n<p>Lead organizer <a href="http://www.ashleighaxios.com/" target="_blank">Ashleigh Axios</a>, Design Exponent at Automattic, said inspiration for the event came from the exclusion that is everywhere in the industry. Automattic is partnering with Mash-Up Americans and MIT Center for Civic Media to bring awareness to the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exclusion is all around us, but we don&#8217;t often take the time to understand how it&#8217;s come to be this way, our place in its existence, and our place in combating it,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Together, we&#8217;re using research, design, and conversational narrative to open source the prompt to understand the issue of exclusion for further community involvement and refinement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The schedule for the event includes a message on &#8220;Design and Inclusion&#8221; from Automattic&#8217;s <a href="https://x.design.blog/portfolio/john-maeda/" target="_blank">John Maeda</a> and a session on &#8220;Opportunities Missed from Excluded Voices&#8221; from <a href="https://designandexclusionconf.wordpress.com/portfolio/joan-shigekawa/" target="_blank">Joan Shigekawa</a>, former Senior Deputy Chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) during the Obama Administration. The conference also includes four panels with experts from Autodesk, Etsy, Airbnb, and other companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design and Exclusion&#8221; is a pointed conference name that puts the spotlight on the problem participants are trying to address. Axios said this name, as opposed to something like &#8220;Design and Inclusion,&#8221; was a deliberate decision. She said that she and John Maeda felt the need to change the language to reflect a new vantage point on the issue in order to garner new insights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It should now be a well-known fact that technology companies are suffering from a lack of diversity or lack of inclusion in their teams and companies,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;This is well-reported and the pressure is building to take on this issue from early-childhood education to educating company human resource offices and hiring managers from questioning social and gender norms as relates to professional roles to crediting those who have been doing the work and not having their contributions and presence well acknowledged. This important work has dominated the &#8216;inclusion&#8217; dialogue within technology-enabled spaces for good reason.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, equally important and much less discussed, are all of the ways in which products and services can be, and often are, designed and built to exclude individuals and people groups, even if unintentionally. We shouldn&#8217;t have to wait until a company crosses the line, creating a public relations nightmare, in order to evaluate the failures in creating inclusive products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More than 1,000 people have already signed up for a reminder about when the event takes place. Axios said that even if the event is successful, organizers are not planning to make it an in-person event in the future. The online-only event was designed to offer more access to the conversation than traditional in-person conferences generally provide.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In-person conferences tend to exclude those without financial means to travel or with geographic hurdles to attendance, those with time-prohibiting personal or professional commitments, those who have difficulty navigating crowds or in-person social interactions, and those who prefer to consume information at their own pace and in their choice of format,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Given the topic, it&#8217;s our aim that Design and Exclusion be as inclusive as it can while limiting its environmental impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Axios said one of the goals of the conference is to understand the industry&#8217;s failures in excluding people as a first step towards creating more inclusive products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design and Exclusion aims to do that as an honest and open dialogue with many representatives from across tech,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Success will be active participation in this event followed by the broader conversation around this topic from contributors beyond those involved in the initial discussion. To broadly measure success, we&#8217;ll look at views on the content, engagement online using #DesignX, and will track any increase in conversation by use of keywords associated with this topic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Design and Exclusion kicks off at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 4pm UTC / 5pm GMT on April 21 and the <a href="https://x.design.blog/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> has been published to the event&#8217;s website. Participants who want to join the discussion on making the web more inclusive are invited to use the #DesignX hashtag on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social networks.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 22:04:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"WPTavern: Inuagural CabinPress Takes Place November 3-5, at Lake Louisa State Park in Clermont, FL";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68825";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"https://wptavern.com/inuagural-cabinpress-takes-place-november-3-5-at-lake-louisa-state-park-in-clermont-fl";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3050:"<p>If spending time in the <a href="https://wptavern.com/disconnect-from-technology-at-camp-press-september-23-24-in-seminole-ok">woods in Oklahoma</a> to disconnect from technology is not your thing, perhaps staying at a cabin in Florida is. <a href="https://cabin.press/">CabinPress</a>, organized by <a href="https://davidlaietta.com/">David Laietta</a>, takes place November 3-5, at¬†<a href="https://cabin.press/location/">Lake Louisa State Park in Clermont, FL</a>.</p>\n<p>The location is about an hour&#8217;s drive from Orlando, FL and is 4,500 acres large with lakes, hills, and scenic¬†areas.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href="http://camp.press/">CampPress</a>, CabinPress&#8217; goal is to disconnect people from technology to¬†allow them to focus on building and strengthening personal relationships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I enjoy camping and spending some time disconnected from technology, spending time with others,&#8221; Laietta said. &#8220;I get the most out of a conference when I have the opportunity to have deeper discussions with others than general &#8216;we&#8217;re crushing it, work is fine&#8217; chats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is much more comfortable than camping though, so the focus can be on having fun and making connections, while still having a real bed and hot showers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Accommodations include fully furnished cabins with beds, air conditioning, kitchens, and bathrooms.

Many parents have a difficult time understanding the professions of their grown children, especially when they are in the tech industry. This can also be compounded by the novelty of remote work, which sometimes prompts questions like, &#8220;Just what is it that you do all day?&#8221; or &#8220;When are you going to get a real job?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team at <a href="https://yoast.com/" target="_blank">Yoast</a> decided to be proactive about the problem of families not understanding their work by hosting an event called &#8220;Bring Your Parents to Work Day.&#8221; Yoast employs a team of nearly 50 people, with 40 employees working in a central office located in Wijchen, Netherlands, and 10 working remotely. The family event brought 42 parents to the office.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just awesome to have everyone&#8217;s &#8216;home&#8217; team understand what we do and relate to it,&#8221; CEO Joost de Valk said.</p>\n<p>Yoast Community Manager Taco Verdonschot brought his father to work today. His photo below shows all of the parents attending a presentation from Joost and Marieke de Valk about WordPress, open source, and Yoast&#8217;s products.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is ''Bring your parents to work day'' at <a href="https://twitter.com/yoast">@yoast</a>. <br />Intended result: our parents finally understand what we really do! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/byptwd?src=hash">#byptwd</a> <a href="https://t.co/WuhHlGhyeX">pic.twitter.com/WuhHlGhyeX</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Taco Verdo (@TacoVerdo) <a href="https://twitter.com/TacoVerdo/status/852866379309088768">April 14, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;Most parents didn‚Äôt know too much about WordPress and/or open source,&#8221; Verdonschot said. &#8220;They told the parents about our mission to make the web a better place for everyone and to make SEO available for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the presentation Verdonschot said employees showed their parents around the office and Joost took them in small groups across the street to a second office the company will be opening soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We ended the Bring Your Parents to Work Day with drinks and snacks (home-made by my colleague Chris),&#8221; Verdonschot said. &#8220;Personally, I really liked meeting my colleagues‚Äô parents. Some of them just look so much like their mom/dad! I really think that the presentation gave our parents a better understanding of what we do at Yoast, and how much we‚Äôre loving what we do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Bring Your Parents to Work&#8221; event has been gaining popularity in the past two years. Many large companies participated in 2016, including LinkedIn, Dogfish Head Brewery, HubSpot, ASOS, and British Airways. Verdonschot hasn&#8217;t confirmed with the directors yet, but based on the success of today&#8217;s event, he expects Yoast will make this an annual event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me personally, I really like that my parents have visited the office and met my colleagues, because the world I work in now feels less strange for them,&#8221; Verdonschot said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 21:13:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Free React Fundamentals Course Updated for React v15.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68772";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://wptavern.com/free-react-fundamentals-course-updated-for-react-v15-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2976:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/react-training.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ways to expand your ReactJS knowledge, the free <a href="https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals" target="_blank">React Fundamentals</a> course from ReactTraining.com has been updated for the latest <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html" target="_blank">React v15.5</a> release. The 48-lesson course takes approximately 287 minutes to complete. It was designed for a wide range of professionals, including backend engineers new to JavaScript, Bootcamp graduates and front-end developers who want to expand their skill sets, and JavaScript developers coming from other frameworks.</p>\n<p>In the React Fundamentals course students will get an introduction to the React ecosystem and will learn how to set up a React component with NPM, Babel, and Webpack. The course covers topics like dataflow with Props, building UIs with Pure Functions, nesting React components, Stateless Functional Components, React Router V4, and more. Complete beginners may struggle, so the course author recommends students enter with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More than 57,000 students have taken React Fundamentals.</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-javascript-survey-results-published-react-emerges-as-clear-winner-in-front-end-frameworks" target="_blank">State of JavaScript survey results</a> showed React as the clear winner among front-end frameworks in terms of developer interest and satisfaction.

The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/" target="_blank">Image Widget plugin</a>, created by Modern Tribe, is one of the most popular with more than 500,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>Widget architecture in WordPress currently relies on PHP and AJAX, but the new image widget will follow the recent trend towards JavaScript interfaces.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the time since WP_Widget was introduced in 2.8, WordPress has made dramatic shifts toward developing interfaces in JavaScript, including with the Customizer in 3.4 and the Media Library in 3.5, and more recently with the focus on the REST API,&#8221; contributors said in the proposal. &#8220;Given that the media widgets are naturally interfacing with the media library JS, it is necessary that the media widgets make use of JavaScript to construct their UI instead of relying on PHP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customizer component co-maintainer Weston Ruter noted in the comments that the new proposed image widget also allows for external images to be embedded by URL. This is a feature that Jetpack offers in its <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/extra-sidebar-widgets/image-widget/" target="_blank">image widget</a>. The new core widget will support both use cases that WordPress users are already familiar with from popular plugins.</p>\n<p>The image widget is the first of several planned JS-powered media widgets, including video, audio, galleries, and slideshows. Ruter said <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/53" target="_blank">progress on the video widget</a> is coming along well and he anticipates it will likely land next. Contributors have begun work on the audio widget, but Ruter said galleries and slideshows are a higher priority.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, who is leading core development this year, confirmed in his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/13/first-quarter-check-in/" target="_blank">quarterly update</a> today that the image widget will be considered for 4.8.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is for the larger block-driven customization work to kick off in June,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Prior to that, we‚Äôre focusing on widgets and other low-hanging fruit. Lack of developers slowed us down the last few months, now doing better but could still use more help there. Media widgets + WYSIWYG on text widget seem simple but will have a big user impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors on the Customizer team are asking for developers and users to test the new image widget. The latest version of the plugin is available on <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/" target="_blank">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin is also available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 21:32:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: Hacked Home Routers are Launching Brute Force Attacks on WordPress Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=68715";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"https://wptavern.com/hacked-home-routers-are-launching-brute-force-attacks-on-wordpress-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5930:"<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fortune-cookie.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: Eduardo Mueses <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38692570@N00/13082910524">The Oracle</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Security researchers at Wordfence are reporting that thousands of hacked home routers are <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/home-routers-attacking-wordpress/" target="_blank">attacking WordPress sites</a>. Wordfence firewall and malware scanner products are in use on more than 2 million WordPress sites and the company estimates that 6.7% of all attacks on these sites are coming from hacked home routers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the past month alone we have seen over 57,000 unique home routers being used to attack WordPress sites,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;Those home networks are now being explored by hackers who have full access to them via the hacked home router. They can access workstations, mobile devices, wifi cameras, wifi climate control and any other devices that use the home WiFi network.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maunder said his team has mostly seen brute force attacks targeting both wp-login.php (the traditional login endpoint for WordPress) and also XMLRPC login. They have also seen a small percentage of complex attacks. Wordfence has detected a total of 67 million individual attacks from the routers the company identified in March.</p>\n<p>While Wordfence researchers were creating their <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/march-2017-wordpress-attack-report/" target="_blank">monthly attack report</a>, they noticed that Algeria had jumped in rankings from position 60 to 24 in thier ‚ÄúTop Attacking Countries‚Äù list. Their review of attack data in Algeria revealed a &#8216;long tail&#8217; of more than 10,000 attacking IPs originating from an Algerian state owned ISP.</p>\n<p>A vulnerability known as &#8220;<a href="http://mis.fortunecook.ie/" target="_blank">misfortune cookie</a>&#8221; is being used in these attacks. It hijacks a service that ISP&#8217;s use to remotely manage home routers by listening on port number 7547. ISP&#8217;s should close general internet access to this port, but many have not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It appears that attackers have exploited home routers on Algeria‚Äôs state owned telecommunications network and are using the exploited routers to attack WordPress websites globally,&#8221; Maunder said.</p>\n<p>Wordfence researchers scanned the devices to find out what services they are running and found that they are Zyxel routers usually used in a home internet setting. They found that many of them have a severe and well-known vulnerability in RomPager, the embedded web server from AllegroSoft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We then dug deeper and discovered that many ISPs around the world have this same issue and those routers are attacking WordPress sites via brute force attacks,&#8221; Maunder said.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Tony Perez, CEO of <a href="https://sucuri.net/" target="_blank">Sucuri</a> to see if his team has detected anything similar. Sucuri also tracks <a href="https://sucuri.net/security-reports/brute-force/" target="_blank">WordPress brute force attempts</a>, but Perez said current numbers are not remarkable when compared historically to mid-2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the reason Sucuri and other companies are not seeing this is because it is a weak ranking signal for malicious behavior,&#8221; Maunder said. &#8220;As we point out in the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/home-routers-attacking-wordpress/" target="_blank">report</a>, each of these IPs is only doing between 50 and 1000 attacks per month on sites. They also only attack for a few hours each. These combined are a very weak ranking signal for malicious behavior. That low frequency also makes the attacks more effective because they are less likely to be blocked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular security issue is unusual in that the vulnerability is with the routers, not with WordPress itself. The attackers bulk hack thousands of devices, upload a WordPress attack script and a list of targets, and then they have thousands of routers under their control to attack WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>This type of botnet isn&#8217;t terribly uncommon, as <a href="https://blog.eset.ie/2017/04/06/sathurbot-distributed-wordpress-password-attack/" target="_blank">security researchers from from ESET recently uncovered a new malware called Sathurbot</a> that uses torrent files as a method of distributing coordinated brute-force attacks on WordPress sites. The vulnerability in this instance is not in the software but rather in weak WordPress administrator accounts.</p>\n<p>Protecting against brute force attacks starts with a strong administrator password. There are also many popular plugins, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/" target="_blank">Shield Security</a>, the <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/security-features/" target="_blank">Jetpack Protect module</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/" target="_blank">iThemes Security</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/" target="_blank">Wordfence</a>, which offer protection from brute force attacks.</p>\n<p>If you want to make sure your router is not vulnerable to being recruited for these attacks, Wordfence has created a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/" target="_blank">tool</a> that makes it easy to check. It detects whether your home router has port 7547 open or if it‚Äôs running a vulnerable version of RomPager. If you find that your router is vulnerable or port 7547 is open, Wordfence has published <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/" target="_blank">instructions for how to secure your device</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:46:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 04 May 2017 23:50:03 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 04 May 2017 23:30:09 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20150808165813";}', 'no');

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href="https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/" rel="nofollow">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href="https://yoast.com/" rel="nofollow">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/" rel="nofollow">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo" rel="nofollow">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href="https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/" rel="nofollow">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin alsgruo allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel="next"</code> and <code>rel="prev"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href="https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/" rel="nofollow">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href="https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/" rel="nofollow">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href="https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/" rel="nofollow">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href="https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/" rel="nofollow">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href="http://translate.yoast.com" rel="nofollow">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" rel="nofollow">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

translations, and switched to language packs for Croatian, Spanish (Chile) and Greek.</li>\n<li>Sync was running into issues so we&#8217;ve limited dequeue time to 1/3 of PHP&#8217;s max execution time, which has unclogged the problem.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;re now sending full and incremental queues separately so that a failure in one doesn&#8217;t block the other.</li>\n<li>There was a JavaScript

Importer&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you would prefer to do things manually then follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>wordpress-importer</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the Tools -&gt; Import screen, click on WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n</dd>\n<dt>Help! I&#8217;m getting out of memory errors or a blank screen.</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>If your exported file is very large, the import script may run into your host&#8217;s configured memory limit for PHP.</p>\n<p>A message like &#8220;Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted&#8221; indicates that the script can&#8217;t successfully import your XML file under the current PHP memory limit. If you have access to the php.ini file, you can manually increase the limit; if you do not (your WordPress installation is hosted on a shared server, for instance), you might have to break your exported XML file into several smaller pieces and run the import script one at a time.</p>\n<p>For those with shared hosting, the best alternative may be to consult hosting support to determine the safest approach for running the import. A host may be willing to temporarily lift the memory limit and/or run the process directly from their end.</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#Before_Importing" rel="nofollow">WordPress Codex: Importing Content</a></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><!--section=changelog--></p>\n<h4>0.6.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for import term metadata.</li>\n<li>Fix bug that caused slashes to be stripped from imported content.</li>\n<li>Fix bug that caused characters to be stripped inside of CDATA in some cases.</li>\n<li>Fix PHP notices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add wp_import_existing_post filter.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world‚Äôs favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=''youtube-player'' type=''text/html'' width=''640'' height=''390'' src=''https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent'' allowfullscreen=''true'' style=''border:0;''></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you‚Äôd like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It‚Äôs all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It‚Äôs all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there‚Äôs never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it‚Äôs kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" rel="nofollow">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" rel="nofollow">Storefront child themes</a>. It‚Äôs all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client‚Äôs store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store‚Äôs data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store‚Äôs features to meet your client‚Äôs unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you‚Äôll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.</p>\n<p>The option default to NOT being behind a proxy &#8212; which should be by far the common case.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Can I whitelist my IP so I don&#8217;t get locked out?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>First please consider if you really need this. Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.</p>\n<p>That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: &#8220;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nfunction my_ip_whitelist($allow, $ip) {<br />\n     return ($ip == &#8216;my-ip&#8217;) ? true : $allow;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8217;, &#8216;my_ip_whitelist&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<p>Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

(167, 2, '2015-10-12 00:54:27', '2015-10-12 08:54:27', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

(168, 2, '2015-09-28 18:54:27', '2015-09-29 02:54:27', 'On a macro level, a culture of corruption is demoralizing. Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‚Äòreactive‚Äô one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company‚Äôs anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture. Not only should the code of ethics be driven by senior management but there must be ‚Äòsupport from the middle‚Äô; engraining integrity in day-to-day operations across the local offices and in the orientation of new employees.\r\n\r\nFundamental to a successful anti-corruption program should be regular integrity training at both corporate level and across local teams. The purpose of these training sessions are threefold; to introduce or elevate awareness, clarify a company‚Äôs expectations, and provide tools and resources to employees should they encounter unethical situations.\r\n\r\nOmega advocates training based on real-life scenarios, specific to each local market. It is important that employees understand a company‚Äôs expectations on handling of unethical situations, such as attempted bribery. For example, just because the employee didn‚Äôt accept a bribe doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt a bribe and it should therefore be reported.\r\n\r\nIn Omega‚Äôs experience, training sessions are typically followed by a spike in reports of unethical behavior allowing companies to understand where the potential hotspots may be and focus resources accordingly.\r\n\r\nManaging an anti-corruption program across multiple offices, in culturally distinct markets, can be daunting. Omega has vast experience dealing with supply chain integrity risks.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\n\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\n\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\n\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\n\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\n\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\n\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\n\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\n\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

(193, 2, '2015-10-14 18:01:22', '2015-10-15 02:01:22', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

(199, 2, '2015-10-22 23:32:13', '2015-10-23 07:32:13', 'Within the industry, the question is often ‚Äòhow can brands move away from auditing and towards a more productive, sustainable model?‚Äô\r\n\r\nWhilst concerns over audit fatigue and the inefficiencies of having so many different client codes are valid, there is still great value in social compliance auditing. Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe.

(200, 2, '2015-10-22 23:32:54', '2015-10-23 07:32:54', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

Purchase orders awarded to poorly qualified suppliers, factories with egregious ethical issues becoming part of your supply chain or defective shipments being passed. ¬†Not only are there commercial risks but legal ones, particularly with regard to the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act.¬† Consequently, within corporations, supplier corruption is often viewed through a legal prism with the immediate termination of business relationships the standard response.¬† While this approach is understandable, it is not always commercially practical. ¬†The issue is deep routed, pervasive and, to an extent, cultural.¬† There is an incompatibility between the requirements of the foreign company and business practices on the ground.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of the challenge it is crucial that all parties, from sourcing entities, auditing bodies and 3<sup>rd</sup> party inspectors adopt a preventative, collaborative and transparent approach to bribery in the supply chain.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, policies and procedures must be clearly communicated, internally and externally, making clear that bribery is unacceptable.¬† Omega advocates separate employee and supplier ethics training sessions with real life case studies and scenarios. These should be delivered in person to all associates with different combinations of classroom and e-learning used in refresher courses.¬† As the program matures, targeted management and non-management training may be incorporated.\r\n\r\nA culture of transparency and honesty throughout an organization is, without doubt, the best bastion though.¬† Fundamental to any success is the reporting of any incidents of bribery, even if not accepted, to management. ¬†To facilitate this, reporting channels must be established, with formal incident reporting procedures, and management must create time to receive reports and follow-up on issues.¬† Reports of bribery not only identify where problems lie, but also, by analyzing inter-office, or cross-office, trends they show where problems, purportedly, do not lie.¬† The ‚Äòabsence‚Äô of bribery is often very revealing in itself. It is also important that auditors understand that reporting bribery protects them from reprisal. ¬†Omega has encountered scenarios where associates have refused a bribe, failed to report it, then suppliers have preemptively lodged complaints against them instead.\r\n\r\nFostering the correct environment is challenging, requiring patience and pressure from all levels.¬† In our experience, associates are often, initially, reluctant to report bribery for a myriad of reasons. It is commonly perceived as a means of creating more work for themselves, drawing unwanted attention, as well as risking reprisal from suppliers and even colleagues.¬† Countering these issues is a challenge. It is important that the message remains consistent and incident reporting remains a cornerstone of an anti-corruption program. It is important to implement a no-retaliation policy and to remind employees and suppliers frequently. Dedicated monthly calls should be held from Corporate Office with the country teams to discuss incident reports, follow-up on specific cases, discuss trends and, as necessary, ask searching questions. Further, effective reporting of bribery should be built into employee performance appraisals.\r\n\r\nBribery in supply chains is a complex, ongoing challenge and best combatted by a preventative, collaborative approach with pressure from all levels.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

(229, 4, '2015-12-10 22:23:05', '2015-12-11 06:23:05', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

(254, 4, '2016-01-27 22:36:35', '2016-01-28 06:36:35', 'Incidents of bribery, or attempted bribery, occur every day, across all markets, at all points along the supply chain.¬† There is a widely held belief that immediate termination of a supplier is the only solution. Due to the commercial impact of this practice, few organizations are prepared to confront the issue and a blind eye is often turned allowing the problem to fester.\r\n\r\nOn a micro level, offering a bribe may result in poorly qualified factories becoming part of your network, manufacturers with egregious ethical issues becoming approved and defective shipments passed. On a macro level, a culture of corruption is demoralizing.¬† Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and otherwise ethical employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the organization. It is critical that businesses develop a coherent strategy to manage supplier corruption which is both preventative and practical.\r\n\r\nOmega recommends that you clearly communicate expectations externally. ¬†For example, company policies on accepting gifts, business entertainment, meals and transportation should be unambiguous and clearly described.¬† Industry practice is to distribute a Vendor Code of Conduct which suppliers sign and return acknowledging their understanding and acceptance. ¬†In reality, these documents are often not even read let alone the information communicated down to the factory level.\r\n\r\nA different approach is needed.¬† Omega recommends that you analyze your supply chain, segmenting key partners, characterized by stable commercial relationships and significant business volume.¬† For an apparel or footwear brand this may be 90% of the supply base while, for a home goods retailer, this may represent just 50%. ¬†Once you have performed this exercise you should ensure that key suppliers fully understand all requirements and, crucially, that they cascade the information to their factories.¬† This is particularly crucial when vendors and factories are increasingly separate entities with production spread across multiple countries.¬† Omega suggests that the Code of Conduct is followed-up with a phone call and the conversation documented. ¬†Omega partners with one client whose VP Sourcing calls each key supplier personally.¬† You may even require your larger suppliers to have their own internal Code of Conduct regulating how their factories operate.\r\n\r\nThe reality is though that, due to local business cultures, suppliers will sometimes attempt to bribe your employees. ¬†It is imperative then that your organization has the requisite procedures to enforce your anti-corruption program. ¬†Employees must understand their responsibility to report the attempted bribe and feel comfortable enough to do so.

As such, their leverage is reduced. It is advisable then that such organizations temper their objectives by segmenting their supply base and focusing on key factories.\r\n\r\nEqually, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brand.¬† As such, the degree by which they will be able to drive onsite improvements is limited.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Should My Program Encompass Every Factory?</strong>\r\nIn an ideal world every manufacturer would be subject to an initial assessment before an order is placed. Dependent on the results, they would then undergo follow-up visits / capacity building programs.¬† However, this approach isn‚Äôt always practical.¬† Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers each year with their smaller factories cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000.¬† For many brands, it may not be affordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment and, for the smaller factories, given how thin their margins are, passing the costs to them is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nShould this be the case then it may be a good idea to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not need to be subject to the same level diligence as ones in China or Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) What is the Commercial Impact of My Program?</strong>\r\nWhile supplier codes of conduct are very similar across the industry, how the principles are actually applied differs vastly from organization to organization.¬† How audit data limits your sourcing teams‚Äô ability to place orders has significant commercial implications.¬† It is important then that your program is practical as well as ambitious. This is particularly true for issues covering working hours in China. Many industry leaders now recognize that China labor laws, governing working hours, are impractical and, instead, follow the recommendations from the FLA.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the better integrated your program is into sourcing the greater its opportunity for success. Not only should your responsible sourcing program be supportive of sourcing, but buying practices should, as far as possible, be supportive of social compliance. The sourcing department should be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\n<strong>4) What is My Policy on Falsified Records?</strong>\r\nOmega estimates that 95% of the factory wage and working hour records it reviews in China, during an initial audit, are falsified. This issue is not unique to China and occurs across all the markets where we operate. While there remains no clear consensus on the issue, factories preparing falsified documents, and auditors reviewing them, is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.¬† Industry best practice is for brands to require complete transparency from their suppliers and provide true records during an audit.\r\n\r\nDepending on the nature of the findings, Omega, again, recommends, segmenting your supplier base and working with key factories on long term remediation programs with, say, 10% improvements in working hours, for example, required every 3-6 months.¬† However, given the financial pressures that many manufacturers operate under it may be necessary to assist them in capacity building also.\r\n\r\n<strong>5) Which Details Should I Publicly Disclose?</strong>\r\nDisclosing factory names and locations, audit results and methodology certainly has benefits.¬† It sets companies apart, placing them at the forefront of the industry. By increasing transparency it potentially reduces audit fatigue as well as generating greater momentum for the responsible sourcing movement overall.\r\n\r\nThis level of transparency though is best suited to companies completely comfortable with, and confident in, their supply chain data. They should also be adept at answering searching questions from other stakeholders as required.¬† Should you wish to publicly disclose elements of your responsible sourcing program, but not to the levels of an industry leader, then Omega suggests revealing more general details, such as numbers of factories audited, follow-ups performed, special projects as well as your aspirational targets.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing responsible sourcing programs.

Purchase orders awarded to poorly qualified suppliers, factories with egregious ethical issues becoming part of your supply chain or defective shipments being passed. ¬†Not only are there commercial risks but legal ones, particularly with regard to the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act.¬† Consequently, within corporations, supplier corruption is often viewed through a legal prism with the immediate termination of business relationships the standard response.¬† While this approach is understandable, it is not always commercially practical. ¬†The issue is deep routed, pervasive and, to an extent, cultural.¬† There is an incompatibility between the requirements of the foreign company and business practices on the ground.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of the challenge it is crucial that all parties, from sourcing entities, auditing bodies and 3<sup>rd</sup> party inspectors adopt a preventative, collaborative and transparent approach to bribery in the supply chain.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, policies and procedures must be clearly communicated, internally and externally, making clear that bribery is unacceptable.¬† Omega advocates separate employee and supplier ethics training sessions with real life case studies and scenarios. These should be delivered in person to all associates with different combinations of classroom and e-learning used in refresher courses.¬† As the program matures, targeted management and non-management training may be incorporated.\r\n\r\nA culture of transparency and honesty throughout an organization is, without doubt, the best bastion though.¬† Fundamental to any success is the reporting of any incidents of bribery, even if not accepted, to management. ¬†To facilitate this, reporting channels must be established, with formal incident reporting procedures, and management must create time to receive reports and follow-up on issues.¬† Reports of bribery not only identify where problems lie, but also, by analyzing inter-office, or cross-office, trends they show where problems, purportedly, do not lie.¬† The ‚Äòabsence‚Äô of bribery is often very revealing in itself. It is also important that auditors understand that reporting bribery protects them from reprisal. ¬†Omega has encountered scenarios where associates have refused a bribe, failed to report it, then suppliers have preemptively lodged complaints against them instead.\r\n\r\nFostering the correct environment is challenging, requiring patience and pressure from all levels.¬† In our experience, associates are often, initially, reluctant to report bribery for a myriad of reasons. It is commonly perceived as a means of creating more work for themselves, drawing unwanted attention, as well as risking reprisal from suppliers and even colleagues.¬† Countering these issues is a challenge. It is important that the message remains consistent and incident reporting remains a cornerstone of an anti-corruption program. It is important to implement a no-retaliation policy and to remind employees and suppliers frequently. Dedicated monthly calls should be held from Corporate Office with the country teams to discuss incident reports, follow-up on specific cases, discuss trends and, as necessary, ask searching questions. Further, effective reporting of bribery should be built into employee performance appraisals.\r\n\r\nBribery in supply chains is a complex, ongoing challenge and best combatted by a preventative, collaborative approach with pressure from all levels.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

(266, 4, '2016-01-27 22:24:34', '2016-01-28 06:24:34', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‚Äòreactive‚Äô one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company‚Äôs anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture. Not only should the code of ethics be driven by senior management but there must be ‚Äòsupport from the middle‚Äô; engraining integrity in day-to-day operations across the local offices and in the orientation of new employees.\r\n\r\nFundamental to a successful anti-corruption program should be regular integrity training at both corporate level and across local teams. The purpose of these training sessions are threefold; to introduce or elevate awareness, clarify a company‚Äôs expectations, and provide tools and resources to employees should they encounter unethical situations.\r\n\r\nOmega advocates training based on real-life scenarios, specific to each local market. It is important that employees understand a company‚Äôs expectations on handling of unethical situations, such as attempted bribery. For example, just because the employee didn‚Äôt accept a bribe doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt a bribe and it should therefore be reported.\r\n\r\nIn Omega‚Äôs experience, training sessions are typically followed by a spike in reports of unethical behavior allowing companies to understand where the potential hotspots may be and focus resources accordingly.\r\n\r\nManaging an anti-corruption program across multiple offices, in culturally distinct markets, can be daunting.

The 2 story building, located in a northern suburb of Manila, was gutted when sparks, flying from a welding machine, ignited flammable chemicals stored close by.\r\n\r\nSince the factory was manufacturing for the local, Philippines, market, and not for western brands and retailers, it had not been subject to industry codes of conduct, nor third party monitoring, often a prerequisite to doing business. Certainly, a combination of better education, correct client pressure, as well third party monitoring, may have prevented this tragedy. The issues at Kentex could have been prevented through compliance with basic factory safety codes. For example, Kentex did not have a designated safety officer, responsible for the safe storage of flammable liquids, nor were there any alarms nor sprinklers at the factory. Further, workers could not find their way out of the factory safely and became trapped due to an insufficient number of fire exits and a locked door.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were more fundamental problems at play, commonplace across The Philippines, which combined with these more preventable issues to cause the tragedy. Firstly, there had been a significant failure by the local government who had issued Kentex with a business permit without requiring them to produce a valid, fire safety inspection certificate. The causes for this are unclear but local corruption is an ongoing challenge in The Philippines as is the need to increase tax revenues through encouraging local businesses. Also, Kentex was reported to have been dangerously overcrowded. This, however, would have been challenging to detect during a third party audit since the factory subcontracted the majority of its workforce and therefore the necessary employee records, which would have elevated this issue, would not have been available onsite.\r\n\r\nAs this tragedy illustrates, responsible sourcing is an ongoing, complex challenge. While compliance with basic safety measures should always be met, there are often more significant issues at hand. All too often fundamental failures at local level create a social responsibility vacuum which brands and retailers are expected to fill.

(278, 4, '2016-02-02 17:22:52', '2016-02-03 01:22:52', '<strong>1) How Much Leverage Do I Have?</strong>\r\nYour programs objectives must be compatible with your leverage. ¬†A common misperception is that consumer brands all hold great sway over the working conditions across their factory base.¬† While this premise holds true for a select number of companies, the reality is that brand influence over their suppliers is often limited.¬† Typically, the greatest leverage is held by the large apparel and footwear brands; benefiting from entrenched manufacturing bases who receive large orders on a regular basis. ¬†It is these companies which are best placed to develop more ambitious programs; encompassing capacity building, long-term remediation and, more recently, tier 2 suppliers.\r\n\r\nA home goods retailer, however, faces different challenges.¬† This is due to the nature of their products; typically sourced from a far greater number of factories, often via trading entities, one time buys, with significantly less business placed per supplier. As such, their leverage is reduced. It is advisable then that such organizations temper their objectives by segmenting their supply base and focusing on key factories.\r\n\r\nEqually, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brand.¬† As such, the degree by which they will be able to drive onsite improvements is limited.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Should My Program Encompass Every Factory?</strong>\r\nIn an ideal world every manufacturer would be subject to an initial assessment before an order is placed. Dependent on the results, they would then undergo follow-up visits / capacity building programs.¬† However, this approach isn‚Äôt always practical.¬† Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers each year with their smaller factories cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000.¬† For many brands, it may not be affordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment and, for the smaller factories, given how thin their margins are, passing the costs to them is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nShould this be the case then it may be a good idea to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not need to be subject to the same level diligence as ones in China or Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) What is the Commercial Impact of My Program?</strong>\r\nWhile supplier codes of conduct are very similar across the industry, how the principles are actually applied differs vastly from organization to organization.¬† How audit data limits your sourcing teams‚Äô ability to place orders has significant commercial implications.¬† It is important then that your program is practical as well as ambitious. This is particularly true for issues covering working hours in China. Many industry leaders now recognize that China labor laws, governing working hours, are impractical and, instead, follow the recommendations from the FLA.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the better integrated your program is into sourcing the greater its opportunity for success. Not only should your responsible sourcing program be supportive of sourcing, but buying practices should, as far as possible, be supportive of social compliance. The sourcing department should be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\n<strong>4) What is My Policy on Falsified Records?</strong>\r\nOmega estimates that 95% of the factory wage and working hour records it reviews in China, during an initial audit, are falsified. This issue is not unique to China and occurs across all the markets where we operate. While there remains no clear consensus on the issue, factories preparing falsified documents, and auditors reviewing them, is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.¬† Industry best practice is for brands to require complete transparency from their suppliers and provide true records during an audit.\r\n\r\nDepending on the nature of the findings, Omega, again, recommends, segmenting your supplier base and working with key factories on long term remediation programs with, say, 10% improvements in working hours, for example, required every 3-6 months.¬† However, given the financial pressures that many manufacturers operate under it may be necessary to assist them in capacity building also.\r\n\r\n<strong>5) Which Details Should I Publicly Disclose?</strong>\r\nDisclosing factory names and locations, audit results and methodology certainly has benefits.¬† It sets companies apart, placing them at the forefront of the industry.

Purchase orders awarded to poorly qualified suppliers, factories with egregious ethical issues becoming part of your supply chain or defective shipments being passed. ¬†Not only are there commercial risks but legal ones, particularly with regard to the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act.¬† Consequently, within corporations, supplier corruption is often viewed through a legal prism with the immediate termination of business relationships the standard response.¬† While this approach is understandable, it is not always commercially practical. ¬†The issue is deep routed, pervasive and, to an extent, cultural.¬† There is an incompatibility between the requirements of the foreign company and business practices on the ground.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of the challenge it is crucial that all parties, from sourcing entities, auditing bodies and 3<sup>rd</sup> party inspectors adopt a preventative, collaborative and transparent approach to bribery in the supply chain.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, policies and procedures must be clearly communicated, internally and externally, making clear that bribery is unacceptable.¬† Omega advocates separate employee and supplier ethics training sessions with real life case studies and scenarios. These should be delivered in person to all associates with different combinations of classroom and e-learning used in refresher courses.¬† As the program matures, targeted management and non-management training may be incorporated.\r\n\r\nA culture of transparency and honesty throughout an organization is, without doubt, the best bastion though.¬† Fundamental to any success is the reporting of any incidents of bribery, even if not accepted, to management. ¬†To facilitate this, reporting channels must be established, with formal incident reporting procedures, and management must create time to receive reports and follow-up on issues.¬† Reports of bribery not only identify where problems lie, but also, by analyzing inter-office, or cross-office, trends they show where problems, purportedly, do not lie.¬† The ‚Äòabsence‚Äô of bribery is often very revealing in itself. It is also important that auditors understand that reporting bribery protects them from reprisal. ¬†Omega has encountered scenarios where associates have refused a bribe, failed to report it, then suppliers have preemptively lodged complaints against them instead.\r\n\r\nFostering the correct environment is challenging, requiring patience and pressure from all levels.¬† In our experience, associates are often, initially, reluctant to report bribery for a myriad of reasons. It is commonly perceived as a means of creating more work for themselves, drawing unwanted attention, as well as risking reprisal from suppliers and even colleagues.¬† Countering these issues is a challenge. It is important that the message remains consistent and incident reporting remains a cornerstone of an anti-corruption program. It is important to implement a no-retaliation policy and to remind employees and suppliers frequently. Dedicated monthly calls should be held from Corporate Office with the country teams to discuss incident reports, follow-up on specific cases, discuss trends and, as necessary, ask searching questions. Further, effective reporting of bribery should be built into employee performance appraisals.\r\n\r\nBribery in supply chains is a complex, ongoing challenge and best combatted by a preventative, collaborative approach with pressure from all levels.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

(282, 4, '2016-02-02 17:24:20', '2016-02-03 01:24:20', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‚Äòreactive‚Äô one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company‚Äôs anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture.

As such, their leverage is reduced. It is advisable then that such organizations temper their objectives by segmenting their supply base and focusing on key factories.\r\n\r\nEqually, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brand.¬† As such, the degree by which they will be able to drive onsite improvements is limited.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Should My Program Encompass Every Factory?</strong>\r\nIn an ideal world every manufacturer would be subject to an initial assessment before an order is placed. Dependent on the results, they would then undergo follow-up visits / capacity building programs.¬† However, this approach isn‚Äôt always practical.¬† Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers each year with their smaller factories cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000.¬† For many brands, it may not be affordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment and, for the smaller factories, given how thin their margins are, passing the costs to them is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nShould this be the case then it may be a good idea to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not need to be subject to the same level diligence as ones in China or Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) What is the Commercial Impact of My Program?</strong>\r\nWhile supplier codes of conduct are very similar across the industry, how the principles are actually applied differs vastly from organization to organization.¬† How audit data limits your sourcing teams‚Äô ability to place orders has significant commercial implications.¬† It is important then that your program is practical as well as ambitious. This is particularly true for issues covering working hours in China. Many industry leaders now recognize that China labor laws, governing working hours, are impractical and, instead, follow the recommendations from the FLA.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the better integrated your program is into sourcing the greater its opportunity for success. Not only should your responsible sourcing program be supportive of sourcing, but buying practices should, as far as possible, be supportive of social compliance. The sourcing department should be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\n<strong>4) What is My Policy on Falsified Records?</strong>\r\nOmega estimates that 95% of the factory wage and working hour records it reviews in China, during an initial audit, are falsified. This issue is not unique to China and occurs across all the markets where we operate. While there remains no clear consensus on the issue, factories preparing falsified documents, and auditors reviewing them, is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.¬† Industry best practice is for brands to require complete transparency from their suppliers and provide true records during an audit.\r\n\r\nDepending on the nature of the findings, Omega, again, recommends, segmenting your supplier base and working with key factories on long term remediation programs with, say, 10% improvements in working hours, for example, required every 3-6 months.¬† However, given the financial pressures that many manufacturers operate under it may be necessary to assist them in capacity building also.\r\n\r\n<strong>5) Which Details Should I Publicly Disclose?</strong>\r\nDisclosing factory names and locations, audit results and methodology certainly has benefits.¬† It sets companies apart, placing them at the forefront of the industry. By increasing transparency it potentially reduces audit fatigue as well as generating greater momentum for the responsible sourcing movement overall.\r\n\r\nThis level of transparency though is best suited to companies completely comfortable with, and confident in, their supply chain data. They should also be adept at answering searching questions from other stakeholders as required.¬† Should you wish to publicly disclose elements of your responsible sourcing program, but not to the levels of an industry leader, then Omega suggests revealing more general details, such as numbers of factories audited, follow-ups performed, special projects as well as your aspirational targets.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing responsible sourcing programs.

Purchase orders awarded to poorly qualified suppliers, factories with egregious ethical issues becoming part of your supply chain or defective shipments being passed. ¬†Not only are there commercial risks but legal ones, particularly with regard to the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act.¬† Consequently, within corporations, supplier corruption is often viewed through a legal prism with the immediate termination of business relationships the standard response.¬† While this approach is understandable, it is not always commercially practical. ¬†The issue is deep routed, pervasive and, to an extent, cultural.¬† There is an incompatibility between the requirements of the foreign company and business practices on the ground.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of the challenge it is crucial that all parties, from sourcing entities, auditing bodies and 3<sup>rd</sup> party inspectors adopt a preventative, collaborative and transparent approach to bribery in the supply chain.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, policies and procedures must be clearly communicated, internally and externally, making clear that bribery is unacceptable.¬† Omega advocates separate employee and supplier ethics training sessions with real life case studies and scenarios. These should be delivered in person to all associates with different combinations of classroom and e-learning used in refresher courses.¬† As the program matures, targeted management and non-management training may be incorporated.\r\n\r\nA culture of transparency and honesty throughout an organization is, without doubt, the best bastion though.¬† Fundamental to any success is the reporting of any incidents of bribery, even if not accepted, to management. ¬†To facilitate this, reporting channels must be established, with formal incident reporting procedures, and management must create time to receive reports and follow-up on issues.¬† Reports of bribery not only identify where problems lie, but also, by analyzing inter-office, or cross-office, trends they show where problems, purportedly, do not lie.¬† The ‚Äòabsence‚Äô of bribery is often very revealing in itself. It is also important that auditors understand that reporting bribery protects them from reprisal. ¬†Omega has encountered scenarios where associates have refused a bribe, failed to report it, then suppliers have preemptively lodged complaints against them instead.\r\n\r\nFostering the correct environment is challenging, requiring patience and pressure from all levels.¬† In our experience, associates are often, initially, reluctant to report bribery for a myriad of reasons. It is commonly perceived as a means of creating more work for themselves, drawing unwanted attention, as well as risking reprisal from suppliers and even colleagues.¬† Countering these issues is a challenge. It is important that the message remains consistent and incident reporting remains a cornerstone of an anti-corruption program. It is important to implement a no-retaliation policy and to remind employees and suppliers frequently. Dedicated monthly calls should be held from Corporate Office with the country teams to discuss incident reports, follow-up on specific cases, discuss trends and, as necessary, ask searching questions. Further, effective reporting of bribery should be built into employee performance appraisals.\r\n\r\nBribery in supply chains is a complex, ongoing challenge and best combatted by a preventative, collaborative approach with pressure from all levels.

(296, 4, '2016-03-01 23:04:37', '2016-03-02 07:04:37', 'Within the industry, the question is often ‚Äòhow can brands move away from auditing and towards a more productive, sustainable model?‚Äô\r\n\r\nWhilst concerns over audit fatigue and the inefficiencies of having so many different client codes are valid, there is still great value in social compliance auditing. Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands‚Äô commercial practices. Instead of ‚Äòhow can the industry move away from supplier auditing?‚Äô the question should be ‚Äòhow can we utilize auditing more effectively?‚Äô\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn‚Äôt ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands‚Äô ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

(297, 4, '2016-03-01 23:05:07', '2016-03-02 07:05:07', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‚Äòreactive‚Äô one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company‚Äôs anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture. Not only should the code of ethics be driven by senior management but there must be ‚Äòsupport from the middle‚Äô; engraining integrity in day-to-day operations across the local offices and in the orientation of new employees.\r\n\r\nFundamental to a successful anti-corruption program should be regular integrity training at both corporate level and across local teams. The purpose of these training sessions are threefold; to introduce or elevate awareness, clarify a company‚Äôs expectations, and provide tools and resources to employees should they encounter unethical situations.\r\n\r\nOmega advocates training based on real-life scenarios, specific to each local market. It is important that employees understand a company‚Äôs expectations on handling of unethical situations, such as attempted bribery. For example, just because the employee didn‚Äôt accept a bribe doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt a bribe and it should therefore be reported.\r\n\r\nIn Omega‚Äôs experience, training sessions are typically followed by a spike in reports of unethical behavior allowing companies to understand where the potential hotspots may be and focus resources accordingly.\r\n\r\nManaging an anti-corruption program across multiple offices, in culturally distinct markets, can be daunting.

(306, 4, '2016-03-02 21:00:51', '2016-03-03 05:00:51', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

This tragic practice is more likely to occur in Tier II factories or undisclosed <a href="https://local.omega.com/modern-supply-chains-pose-challenges/" target="_blank">subcontractors</a>.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the most common form of forced labor, Omega encounters, is retention of foreign worker passports and similar identification. This issue is particularly common in Malaysia, where a significant proportion of Indonesians, and increasingly Nepali, Bangladeshi and Burmese, comprise the labor force, and Thailand, where migrant Cambodian, Laotian and Burmese workers play an important role in the manufacturing sector. ¬†Restricting free movement of labor, this is an egregious violation of the ILO Principles.\r\n\r\nAnother more common example of forced labor is bonded labor where migrant workers are required to repay recruitment fees charged by brokers operating overseas. These fees can be as much as US$7,000 and, automatically deducted from worker salaries, can take up to 2 years to repay.¬† There is a growing awareness of this issue.¬† A number of industry leading companies are taking the lead by prohibiting labor brokers or requiring factories to pay the fee in full. One large apparel brand has even disengaged from Malaysia as a sourcing hub.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach is possible for companies with leverage over suppliers, large electronics brands, for example, it is not always commercially practical.¬† Unlike Health and Safety, there are no industry-wide best practices for managing these more nuanced forms of forced labor.¬† The reality is complex.¬† In Malaysia, for example, factories are legally responsible for the whereabouts of migrant workers and will be fined if a worker becomes unaccounted for.¬† The result is a financial incentive for the factories to restrict worker movement by holding their passports.¬† Added to this, Malaysian labor law is unclear on the legality of this practice.\r\n\r\nWithholding worker identification documents is completely unacceptable, even if the workers have, purportedly, consented to the practice.¬† So what can be done?¬† Assuming that buyers lack the purchasing power to require factories to cease what is a common practice, a more practical approach is required.\r\n\r\nWith immediate effect, factories must terminate the practice and formally implement a revised management system where all passports are returned with the process recorded. ¬†Should factories require access to original passports, for example, they must be stored in a repository which workers can also access.¬† A clear, documented procedure must be established, translated into the migrant workers‚Äô language(s), agreed to and fully understood.¬† An unannounced Follow-up Audit is also required to verify that the revised procedures are effective.\r\n\r\nIt is important that brands and retailers have a clear understanding of how their supply chains are exposed to forced labor and have procedures to identify and remediate issues. While the issue is more common in Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and The Philippines, Omega predicts it will become an increasing issue in China where rising labor costs will create a demand for cheaper migrant labor from neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Laos.\r\n\r\nIdentifying and remediating forced labor is a complex issue.

(317, 4, '2016-03-16 18:36:52', '2016-03-17 02:36:52', '<strong>1) How Much Leverage Do I Have?</strong>\r\nYour programs objectives must be compatible with your leverage. ¬†A common misperception is that consumer brands all hold great sway over the working conditions across their factory base.¬† While this premise holds true for a select number of companies, the reality is that brand influence over their suppliers is often limited.¬† Typically, the greatest leverage is held by the large apparel and footwear brands; benefiting from entrenched manufacturing bases who receive large orders on a regular basis. ¬†It is these companies which are best placed to develop more ambitious programs; encompassing capacity building, long-term remediation and, more recently, tier 2 suppliers.\r\n\r\nA home goods retailer, however, faces different challenges.¬† This is due to the nature of their products; typically sourced from a far greater number of factories, often via trading entities, one time buys, with significantly less business placed per supplier. As such, their leverage is reduced. It is advisable then that such organizations temper their objectives by segmenting their supply base and focusing on key factories.\r\n\r\nEqually, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brands.¬† As such, the degree by which they will be able to drive onsite improvements is limited.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Should My Program Encompass Every Factory?</strong>\r\nIn an ideal world every manufacturer would be subject to an initial assessment before an order is placed. Dependent on the results, they would then undergo follow-up visits / capacity building programs.¬† However, this approach isn‚Äôt always practical.¬† Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers each year with their smaller factories cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000.¬† For many brands, it may not be affordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment and, for the smaller factories, given how thin their margins are, passing the costs to them is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nShould this be the case then it may be a good idea to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not need to be subject to the same level diligence as ones in China or Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) What is the Commercial Impact of My Program?</strong>\r\nWhile supplier codes of conduct are very similar across the industry, how the principles are actually applied differs vastly from organization to organization.¬† How audit data limits your sourcing teams‚Äô ability to place orders has significant commercial implications.¬† It is important then that your program is practical as well as ambitious. This is particularly true for issues covering working hours in China. Many industry leaders now recognize that China labor laws, governing working hours, are impractical and, instead, follow the recommendations from the FLA.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the better integrated your program is into sourcing the greater its opportunity for success. Not only should your responsible sourcing program be supportive of sourcing, but buying practices should, as far as possible, be supportive of social compliance. The sourcing department should be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\n<strong>4) What is My Policy on Falsified Records?</strong>\r\nOmega estimates that 95% of the factory wage and working hour records it reviews in China, during an initial audit, are falsified. This issue is not unique to China and occurs across all the markets where we operate. While there remains no clear consensus on the issue, factories preparing falsified documents, and auditors reviewing them, is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.¬† Industry best practice is for brands to require complete transparency from their suppliers and provide true records during an audit.\r\n\r\nDepending on the nature of the findings, Omega, again, recommends, segmenting your supplier base and working with key factories on long term remediation programs with, say, 10% improvements in working hours, for example, required every 3-6 months.¬† However, given the financial pressures that many manufacturers operate under it may be necessary to assist them in capacity building also.\r\n\r\n<strong>5) Which Details Should I Publicly Disclose?</strong>\r\nDisclosing factory names and locations, audit results and methodology certainly has benefits.¬† It sets companies apart, placing them at the forefront of the industry. By increasing transparency it potentially reduces audit fatigue as well as generating greater momentum for the responsible sourcing movement overall.\r\n\r\nThis level of transparency though is best suited to companies completely comfortable with, and confident in, their supply chain data. They should also be adept at answering searching questions from other stakeholders as required.¬† Should you wish to publicly disclose elements of your responsible sourcing program, but not to the levels of an industry leader, then Omega suggests revealing more general details, such as numbers of factories audited, follow-ups performed, special projects as well as your aspirational targets.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing responsible sourcing programs.

Much more should be done, by brands and retailers, before, during and after the audit, to maximize return on their investment.\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Carefully Define Your Objectives</strong>\r\nConsumer brands and retailers, in most cases, do not hold great sway over the working conditions within their supply chains. The organizations best placed to develop more ambitious programs, encompassing capacity building, long-term remediation and Tier II suppliers, are usually the large apparel and footwear brands. These companies tend to benefit from entrenched manufacturing bases which receive large orders on a regular basis fostering greater fidelity from their supply base.\r\n\r\nA home goods retailer, for example, typically has less leverage. Their products are generally sourced from a far greater number of factories, often via trading entities, one time buys, with a greater spread of business. Under this scenario, Omega recommends tempering objectives. Suppliers should be segmented with follow-up and remediation focused on key factories. Equally, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brands.\r\n\r\nIt may be commercially impractical to audit every factory. Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000 annually. It may be unaffordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment. Given how thin operating margins can be, passing the costs to all suppliers is unrealistic. It may be prudent to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not require the same level of on-site due diligence.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Demand Transparency</strong>\r\nThe ongoing challenge of falsified records is prevalent across all the markets where Omega operates. Without access to the factory‚Äôs real wage and working hour records the value of an onsite social compliance audit is severely limited. In line with industry best practice, Omega recommends that brands demand transparency from their suppliers on the understanding that opening up their authentic records, will not be an obstacle to receiving new business.\r\n\r\nThis approach is not without challenges. It takes time to develop the requisite level of trust from suppliers. Also, there may be pushback from internal divisions. Sourcing may be nervous since, without commercial consequences for the suppliers, transparency is nearly always impossible. Legal departments may also have concerns about maintaining business relationships with suppliers who are not in full compliance with local labor laws. Despite this, the industry is becoming more nuanced. It is generally accepted that reviewing, and, indeed, proving, falsified records are a waste of everyone‚Äôs resources.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Engage Sourcing Divisions</strong>\r\nThe better integrated your company‚Äôs responsible program is into global sourcing, the better the return on investment. The two cannot operate as silos. Sourcing should have responsible sourcing requirements and be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding factory capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\nFurther, lean supply chains enable a more cost-effective responsible sourcing program. Does your organization, for example, really need 15 handbag suppliers?

Much more should be done, by brands and retailers, before, during and after the audit, to maximize return on their investment.\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Carefully Define Your Objectives</strong>\r\nConsumer brands and retailers, in most cases, do not hold great sway over the working conditions within their supply chains. The organizations best placed to develop more ambitious programs, encompassing capacity building, long-term remediation and Tier II suppliers, are usually the large apparel and footwear brands. These companies tend to benefit from entrenched manufacturing bases which receive large orders on a regular basis fostering greater fidelity from their supply base.\r\n\r\nA home goods retailer, for example, typically has less leverage. Their products are generally sourced from a far greater number of factories, often via trading entities, one time buys, with a greater spread of business. Under this scenario, Omega recommends tempering objectives. Suppliers should be segmented with follow-up and remediation focused on key factories. Equally, a smaller, apparel company, whose orders account for say 5% of a factory‚Äôs capacity, will not enjoy the same leverage with that supplier as one of the large, global apparel brands.\r\n\r\nIt may be commercially impractical to audit every factory. Home goods brands, for example, often source from more than 1,000 manufacturers cascading to the point where many are receiving less than USD30,000 annually. It may be unaffordable to subject every site to a full, onsite assessment. Given how thin operating margins can be, passing the costs to all suppliers is unrealistic. It may be prudent to segment your supply base and adopt a risk based approach. For example, factories in lower risk markets may not require the same level of on-site due diligence.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Demand Transparency</strong>\r\nThe ongoing challenge of falsified records is prevalent across all the markets where Omega operates. Without access to the factory‚Äôs real wage and working hour records the value of an onsite social compliance audit is severely limited. In line with industry best practice, Omega recommends that brands demand transparency from their suppliers on the understanding that opening up their authentic records, will not be an obstacle to receiving new business.\r\n\r\nThis approach is not without challenges. It takes time to develop the requisite level of trust from suppliers. Also, there may be pushback from internal divisions. Sourcing may be nervous since, without commercial consequences for the suppliers, transparency is nearly always impossible. Legal departments may also have concerns about maintaining business relationships with suppliers who are not in full compliance with local labor laws. Despite this, the industry is becoming more nuanced. It is generally accepted that reviewing, and, indeed, proving, falsified records are a waste of everyone‚Äôs resources.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) Engage Sourcing Divisions</strong>\r\nThe better integrated your company‚Äôs responsible program is into global sourcing, the better the return on investment. The two cannot operate as silos. Sourcing should have responsible sourcing requirements and be educated on the impact of their buying practices, specifically how rush orders, last minute changes and exceeding factory capacity, can result in, for example, working hour violations.\r\n\r\nFurther, lean supply chains enable a more cost-effective responsible sourcing program.

Our service is flexible; we can just as simply adopt a proprietary standard as we can develop one in line with your precise requirements.</p>\r\nOffering a full spectrum of supply chain auditing services, Omega''s dedicated teams of professionals, expert in their specific disciplines and local to the markets in which they operate, provide many of the world''s best known brands and retailers with eyes and ears in the field.\r\n\r\nOmega''s audit methodology is developed from our unparalleled experience in handling industry best practices within a multitude of product types from around the world.\r\n<h2>RESPONSIBLE SOURCING</h2>\r\nAn industry leader in the social compliance field, Omega performs more than 3,000 social compliance audits annually across China, South Asia, South East Asia, and The Middle East. Representing many of the world''s most ethical companies, Omega provides a window into the working conditions across their global manufacturing base enabling our partners to make critical business decisions in complete confidence.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in the heart of Asia, Omega understands that each market is different. Omega invests heavily in its auditing teams who are vastly knowledgeable, highly experienced, expert in international and local regulations as well as native in the requisite language(s) of their market. We are highly sensitive to local cultures and perform audits as sensitively as possible without disrupting your supplier relationships.\r\n\r\nOmega understands that the most daunting challenge your manufacturers face is not in understanding where their problems lie, but in how to resolve them efficiently and effectively. A different formula is needed. Omega is set apart from its competitors by a focus on corrective action planning and supplier remediation. Omega''s approach is centered upon a real knowledge of the challenges, clear communications, a detailed corrective action plan agreed onsite and practical advice each step of the way.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Omega can support your business please <strong><a href="https://local.omega.com/contact/">contact us</a></strong>.\r\n<h2>SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY</h2>\r\nIn order to demonstrate compliance with international supply chain security standards, importers must continually assess their supply chains to identify, mitigate and eliminate potential security hazards as well as monitor ongoing improvements. Failure to comply with importer security requirements, such as C-TPAT and PIP, may result in Customs delaying your shipments or even having them seized at enormous cost to your business.\r\n\r\nOmega is an industry leader in the supply chain security field. We are expert at working with all supply chain partners, from manufacturers, warehouses, logistics providers to ports and perform in excess of 1,000 security audits each year across more than 20 countries worldwide. Omega has world-class account management experience; developing risk analyses and managing global supply chain security programs for some of the most prestigious importers into the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nYour supply chain is more complicated than you might think.

There is a case to be made for isolating the results of these assessments and separating them out from the overall measurement.¬† However, to do so would be to disregard their value in other areas, uncompromised by their failure to be transparent; machine and fire safety for example.¬† As such, Omega recommends heavily weighting their failure to be transparent into the overall score instead.\r\n\r\nShould companies lack the leverage and/or resources for this type of program there remain other metrics by which they can measure success.¬† Examples include numbers of <a href="https://local.omega.com/worker-health-safety-training-undervalued/" target="_blank">suppliers successfully trained, for example, on specific health and safety issues</a>, or numbers which have worked with consultants to measure and reduce carbon and/or water footprints.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing responsible sourcing programs across complex supply chains.

These three elements are opportunity, rationalization, and pressure.\r\n\r\n<strong> Opportunity</strong>\r\n\r\nBusiness relationships within supply chains are intrinsically close. Suppliers, merchandisers, auditors and inspectors interact on a daily basis, across far flung locations in the developing world, often removed from corporate purview usually in the US or Europe. An apparel merchandiser may run a continuous, multi million dollar program with a single supplier in South China, for example. A leather specialist may visit the same supplier in Indonesia each week for product inspections and an auditor, based in South India, may be responsible for measuring the workplace conditions across just a handful of active suppliers. The risks presented by these scenarios are clear.

Interacting on a daily basis, personal relationships develop and professional boundaries blur leading to an environment where favors become exchanged, with or without the intention of wrong-doing. This is the quintessential slippery slope. Omega has seen compromised relationships begin with a simple pick up from the train station, develop through complimentary lunches or gifts from the supplier‚Äôs showroom then, finally, into overt bribery. Bribery may be masked as cash in envelopes to pay for ‚Äòtransportation‚Äô or ‚Äòrefreshments‚Äô with both sides fully understanding the intent. Relationships quickly become compromised and associates succumb to corruption, with rationalization as a means to breaking the ethical barrier and opening Pandora‚Äôs Box. I‚Äôve done this once already; it isn‚Äôt hurting anyone; everyone else is doing it, so why don‚Äôt I also help myself?\r\n\r\n<strong>Pressure</strong>\r\n\r\nThe fast growing consumer class in Asia, with all the temptations that provides, is a contributing factor also. As such, it is crucial that opportunities to behave dishonestly are carefully regulated and the nuances and gray areas, which open the doors to corruption, are fully understood.\r\n\r\n<strong>What can be done to minimize your exposure?</strong>\r\n\r\nOmega recommends that organizations invest in scenario-based training. These should be classroom initially with refresher courses, via e-learning, provided thereafter. The purpose should be to provide associates with a clear understanding of how to behave when opportunity arises. For example, what is the correct course of action should a supplier courier a set gift vouchers to the office? Should the value of the gifts be taken into consideration? Should they be accepted, reported, rejected or any combination of the above? Also, is it permissible for an associate allowed to purchase an item off the production floor while visiting the factory? What if he or she obtains a receipt? Are the circumstances different if the supplier has an onsite retail outlet?

(476, 4, '2017-02-13 06:26:39', '2017-02-13 14:26:39', '<strong>Fraud Triangle</strong>\r\n\r\nA common mistake made by supply chain executives is viewing corrupt behavior in binary terms: associates are either corruptible or incorruptible. This view is based on the mistaken notion that ‚Äògood people‚Äô are beyond reproach. To view the issue through this prism, in zero sum terms, is to misunderstand human nature. The reality is far more nuanced. Each of us has our own individual pressure points and therefore susceptible to corruption given certain elements, based on a theory developed by Donald Cressey known as the <a href="http://www.acfe.com/fraud-triangle.aspx">Fraud Triangle</a>. These three elements are opportunity, rationalization, and pressure.\r\n\r\n<strong> Opportunity</strong>\r\n\r\nBusiness relationships within supply chains are intrinsically close. Suppliers, merchandisers, auditors and inspectors interact on a daily basis, across far flung locations in the developing world, often removed from corporate purview usually in the US or Europe. An apparel merchandiser may run a continuous, multi million dollar program with a single supplier in South China, for example. A leather specialist may visit the same supplier in Indonesia each week for product inspections and an auditor, based in South India, may be responsible for measuring the workplace conditions across just a handful of active suppliers. The risks presented by these scenarios are clear. For further details, please view our insight <a href="https://local.omega.com/conflicts-of-interest/">Conflict of Interest: A Growing Supply Chain Challenge</a>¬†.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rationalization</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile it is important for all parties to work collaboratively, it is crucial that professional boundaries are clearly stated and transparent. Interacting on a daily basis, personal relationships develop and professional boundaries blur leading to an environment where favors become exchanged, with or without the intention of wrong-doing. This is the quintessential slippery slope.

We are highly sensitive to local cultures and perform audits as sensitively as possible without disrupting your supplier relationships.\r\n\r\nOmega understands that the most daunting challenge your manufacturers face is not in understanding where their problems lie, but in how to resolve them efficiently and effectively. A different formula is needed. Omega is set apart from its competitors by a focus on corrective action planning and supplier remediation.

Failure to comply with importer security requirements, such as C-TPAT and PIP, may result in Customs delaying your shipments or even having them seized at enormous cost to your business.\r\n\r\nOmega is an industry leader in the supply chain security field. We are expert at working with all supply chain partners, from manufacturers, warehouses, logistics providers to ports and perform in excess of 1,000 security audits each year across more than 20 countries worldwide. Omega has world-class account management experience; developing risk analyses and managing global supply chain security programs for some of the most prestigious importers into the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nYour supply chain is more complicated than you might think. With a wide network of suppliers, some large, some small, some experienced and some new, spread over many countries, effectively assuring a secure and compliant supply chain is a daunting challenge.

Should Customs choose to examine your merchandise and determine that it is eligible for duty free benefits then you may be fined and your shipments delayed.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this risk and to provide evidence of a rigorous due diligence process, Omega experts verify from where your supplier is manufacturing your merchandise as well as procuring the relevant raw materials.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Omega can support your business please <strong><a href="https://local.omega.com/contact/">contact us</a></strong>.', 'Auditing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '32-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-02-28 21:35:22', '2017-03-01 05:35:22', '', 32, 'http://local.omega.com/32-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
