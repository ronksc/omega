You can even embed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>. Plugin authors can take advantage of this by adding custom endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Term Metadata </strong>— Taxonomy term metadata is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/04/taxonomy-term-metadata-proposal/">now included</a> in WordPress 4.4. If you&#8217;ve already been using a plugin to implement term metadata, you should read <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">this post</a> on how to prepare. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms.

He mostly uses WordPress for personal projects although he has completed a couple of projects for others. In addition to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/">maintaining a few plugins</a>, he&#8217;s an active translations contributor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Automatic translations for plugins have been a long time coming. WordPress itself already auto-downloads and auto-updates core translations, so it is a natural progression that plugins and themes will receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p>For those who have been following auto plugin translations, it has <a href="http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/">been in the works for years</a>. It came as a welcome surprise in September when it was announced that plugins will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/">finally be able to have language packs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a plugin in the WordPress.org directory, then this is important, welcome, and exciting news. However, as great as an initiative as language packs are for plugins, it <em>seems</em> simpler than it actually is.</p>\n<p>If you are a plugin developer, you have to go through a few steps in order to get this to work for your plugins. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Should You Be Excited About Plugin Language Packs?</h2>\n<p>As a plugin author, I&#8217;m really excited about the new translation system, and so should you. The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polyglots team</a> is making it so that you no longer have to include all of your <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files directly in your plugin. Instead, they will be hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48731" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png?resize=582%2C575" alt="screenshot-1" /></a>The ideal scenario is when a user selects their language (either through a new WordPress install or through <code>Settings &gt; General</code>), the language pack for your plugin will be automatically installed and kept updated.</p>\n<p>This new system accomplishes a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin files are smaller. There&#8217;s no need to include translation files with your plugin.</li>\n<li>Plugin authors no longer need to manage translations/translators.</li>\n<li>End users are automatically able to see a plugin in their own language assuming a translation has already been created for their locale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">How to Prepare for Plugin Language Packs</h2>\n<p>Before we jump into translating plugins, you first need to prepare your plugin for it to work with the new translation setup.</p>\n<p>In order for you to get your plugin prepared to be moved over to the new system, you need to change your text domain to exactly match your WordPress plugin slug. An important reminder is that even if you have changed your plugin&#8217;s name (as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO</a> recently did), the slug does not change. For a more in-depth discussion and tutorial, please follow Otto&#8217;s great post on <a href="http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/">language pack prepwork</a>.</p>\n<p>You are still welcome to include translation files in your plugin, even with language packs enabled. Translation files in your plugin take priority, and if those aren&#8217;t present, that&#8217;s where language packs come in.</p>\n<p>When you are preparing your plugin for language packs, it is important to note that you should avoid removing translation files from your plugin. If you do so, and your plugin is selected for language packs, your existing translations will not be automatically moved over to the new system.</p>\n<p>Do your best to keep your translation files with your plugin until the Polyglots team has informed you that your plugin is ready for language packs.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Wait to Receive the Official Notice</h2>\n<p>The Polyglot team is preparing the plugins in stages to avoid any major hiccups. Assuming your WordPress.org email is up-to-date, you will receive an email when your plugin is ready.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how long it takes before the team reaches your plugin. There are 40,000+ plugins on WordPress.org, so it is not a quick process. WordPress is preparing plugins in batches according to the amount of active installs each plugin has.</p>\n<p>If your plugin has over 30,000+ active installs, then chances are you are on the new system, although I&#8217;ve seen plugins with 10,000+ active installs also be approved.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the process quicker. Please practice patience and eventually your turn will come.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">You’ve Received the E-Mail That Your Plugin Is Ready</h2>\n<p>So you finally receive the email saying that your plugin is going to be uploaded with language pack support. Awesome! This is what the email that I received looks like. Note that I&#8217;m using one of my approved plugins as an example.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Howdy!<br />\n​<br />\nWe&#8217;re emailing you because you&#8217;re an author for the following plugin on WordPress.org:<br />\n​<br />\n* Easy Updates Manager : https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/<br />\n​<br />\nNext week, we intend to import the plugin listed above into the translate.wordpress.org translation system. Language packs will also be enabled for your plugin, for any locales that are fully translated (at 100%).<br />\n​<br />\nAs part of this process, all of the strings in your plugin will be imported into translate.wordpress.org. Additionally, any language files that you ship with your plugin (&#8216;mo&#8217; files) will be imported and synced with their respective locales within translate.wordpress.org.<br />\n​<br />\nNo strings in your plugin? Plugin translations include the ability to translate the readme and display these translations in the localized WordPress.org plugin directories.</p>\n<p>If you have prepared your plugin already then this notice is of no real importance. If you have not yet prepared your plugin and you have received the notice then you need to prepare your plugin ASAP. If you don’t prepare your plugin then… well… I don’t really know, but it won’t be good. So go and prepare your plugin if you have not yet done so.<br />\n&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Your Plugin Is Semi-Ready for Language Packs. Now What?</h2>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-48741 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png?resize=291%2C321" alt="screenshot-22" /></a>A week or so after you receive the notice, your plugin and its translations are moved to <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org">translate.wordpress.org</a>. You will likely not receive a notice when your plugin is moved.</p>\n<p>To find out if it&#8217;s been uploaded, visit your plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org page where you should see a translations section in the right sidebar. Click the <strong>Translate Plugin Name </strong>button<strong>.</strong> If you are brought to a page that looks like the one below then your plugin is uploaded and is ready to be translated.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48734" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png?resize=954%2C611" alt="screenshot-3" /></a>If you see a page that looks different from this (i.e., a Not Found error), your plugin is not yet ready.</p>\n<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve received the e-mail, your plugin is ready, and you&#8217;ve waited a reasonable amount of time, you should be good to go as far as preparing your plugin.</p>\n<p>If it has been over two weeks and your plugin has not yet been uploaded, you should contact the Polyglot team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">on their blog</a>, or in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">#polyglots channel on WordPress Slack</a>. Please exercise extreme patience as the process can take a week or sometimes even two.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Removing Your Translation Files From Your Plugin</h2>\n<p>Now that your plugin is uploaded to the system, you can safely remove the translation files from your plugin. If you don’t have any <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files in your plugin, then you can skip this step.</p>\n<p>One thing to note: You may not want to remove your translation files if your plugin does not have any translations on <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">translate.wordpress.org</a> or translations are not 100% complete.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Making Your Plugin Translatable</h2>\n<p>With all of that stuff out-of-the-way, it’s time to focus on translating your plugin. This is where it can get confusing but try to stick with me.</p>\n<p>By default, you cannot submit translations for your plugin in any language. Because of this, you need to ask the Polyglots team to add you as a translator for your plugin. You can do so by heading over to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polyglots blog</a> and ask them. To make it easier they came up with a template of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/#sample-post">what to say</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Polyglots!</p>\n<p>I am the plugin author for [plugin-name and link to plugin directory]. We have a number of great translation editors that we’d like to be able to approve translation for our plugin(s). Please add the following WordPress.org users as translation editors for their respective locales:<br />\no #ar – @username<br />\no #bn – @username, @username<br />\no #da – @username<br />\no #de-ch – @username<br />\netc…</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, just comment here. Thank you!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, the above will include requests for multiple plugins, but as plugins are being rolled out slowly, it&#8217;s acceptable at the moment to include one request per plugin.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you use WordPress.org usernames and that the user is still active. If you are wondering what languages there are, you can visit <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a> and scroll through the different languages that WordPress supports.</p>\n<p>Please only ask to be added as a translator for the languages you know. You will not be approved if you are not a native speaker for a language.</p>\n<p>At this point, again, patience is needed. The Polyglot team will receive your request and will work through it. If your post doesn&#8217;t show up right away, it&#8217;s because first-time posters are moderated.</p>\n<p>In a week or two, the translators you requested should be added to your plugin. If there are any issues, a Polyglot member will comment on your request with any difficulties encountered or notify you that they have approved your request.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when you are added when you see new badges appear on your WordPress.org profile page. One is a translation editor badge and the other is a translation contributor badge.</p>\n<h2><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48735" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png?resize=601%2C322" alt="screenshot-4" /></a>How Do I Translate?</h2>\n<p>First, visit <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a>, select your language, then click the plugins tab. Search for your plugin and then click the translate project button. You&#8217;ll be brought to a page that looks like the one below. This page is where you can translate your plugin. In this case, my plugin is already translated in the language that I selected.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48736" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png?resize=957%2C587" alt="screenshot-5" /></a>On this table, there are four separate things to translate. Trunk, the stable release (version), and the <code>readme.txt</code> variations. In order for language packs to work, <em>you need to translate all four versions</em>.</p>\n<p>To translate, click on one of the sub-projects. This takes you to the translation page. Here, you can see all of the different strings that need to be translated in your plugin. You can edit a string by clicking the details button, translating it in the text editor, and then clicking the <strong>add translations</strong> button.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48737" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png?resize=947%2C561" alt="screenshot-6" /></a>Even if you&#8217;re not added as an editor for a language, you can still translate a plugin. The only difference is instead of adding the translations directly, you can only request that it be changed. Someone from the Polyglots team will need review and approve your translation suggestions.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Once Your Translations Are Ready</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished translating a language completely, it will be available for people to use. However, it doesn’t become available immediately. It can take one to three days for a translation to be available once you finish it. Again, exercise patience.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when the translation is available when you see it in the translation section on your WordPress.org plugin&#8217;s page. For example, you can see what it looks like in the picture below.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48744" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png?resize=447%2C377" alt="screenshot-7" /></a>Also, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s working if you go into a website (preferably not a live website), download your plugin, and select the language that you want to test in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Plugin Language Packs Are Here to Stay</h2>\n<p>Getting language packs to work properly in WordPress plugins is not exactly a straightforward process, which is precisely why plugins are being rolled out slowly.</p>\n<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer, from the Polyglots team, to translators, and to the plugin authors. Please give props where appropriate as everyone is working hard to make plugin language packs the norm.</p>\n<p>If you are having any trouble, the Polyglots team also has a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/">handbook</a> available which provides some good information on how this new system works.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also do my best to answer any questions in the comment section. If you have additional insight, please weigh in as well.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 02:52:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: Test New WordPress Features Without Installing Anything via TryWPBeta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48713";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3531:"<p>Over the weekend at <a href="https://portland.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Portland, Oregon</a>, Drew Jaynes, a WordPress core developer who also led the 4.2 development cycle presented on the topic of beta testing WordPress.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Jaynes highlights the pros and cons of using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Testing plugin</a> on a testing site and a production site. However, he also cites a third way to test WordPress via <a href="http://wcpdx.trywpbeta.com/">TryWPBeta.com</a>.</p>\n<p> \n<div> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture/trying-out-tomorrows-wordpress-today" title="Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today" target="_blank">Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture" target="_blank">DrewAPicture</a></strong> </div>\n<p>TryWPBeta is a locked down, vanilla install of WordPress trunk using Multisite. To login to the site, use the following credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Jaynes what inspired him to create the site, &#8220;The inspiration for TryWPBeta is to actually have a place for core contributors to test patches on mobile devices, because setting up a tunnel to a local development setup is difficult and a high barrier for a lot of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is to make it possible to spin up a site using trunk (Bleeding edge version of WordPress), apply a specific patch and then freeze it in time so that we can point people there to test on mobile devices,&#8221; Jaynes told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>While you can&#8217;t install themes and plugins yet, the site gives users an opportunity to test new features without worrying about breaking the site. Thanks to TryWPBeta, I was able to test the new <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34903">Post oEmbed feature</a> in 4.4.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48714" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png?resize=1025%2C458" alt="Testing oEmbeds of Posts" /></a>Testing oEmbeds of Posts\n<p>Jaynes started the project at 10up&#8217;s company summit. So far, Scott Reilly, John Blackbourn, Zach Brown, Morgan Estes, and Chris Weigman have contributed to the project. The site is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and updates hourly. He stresses that the site is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time, &#8220;There’s a couple features I’d like to add to make it more robust first,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href="https://demo.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated demo site for users to test drive the software. While I like the idea behind TryWPBeta, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to see added to make it more useful. For instance, a list of items to test that users can check off. Also, an easy way to provide feedback on the listed items that is sent to a place where core developers will read it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to see the WordPress Beta Testing plugin extended to have the features I mentioned above. Between the communication challenges and setting up the environment, the beta testing process in WordPress is not as easy and streamlined as it could be. What ideas do you have that would help increase the testing audience and make the process easier?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:37:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"WPTavern: VersionPress Raises $400K in Seed Funding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48709";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-raises-400k-in-seed-funding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2743:"<p><a href="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress</a>, a version control plugin for WordPress, has <a href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/seed-funding/">raised $400K in seed funding</a> from five investors, led by <a href="http://www.credoventures.com/">Credo Ventures</a> based in Prague. In July of 2014, VersionPress conducted a <a href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $30K. However, the team raised only <strong>45% of the $30,000</strong> funding goal.</p>\n<p>The team pressed on and released the first version back in January. Since then, the team has relied on funding from the <a href="http://versionpress.net/">Early Access Program</a>. Borek Bernard, the lead developer of VersionPress, says the influx of cash will help fuel rapid development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it means that we will be able to develop VersionPress at a more rapid pace. What we currently have in the <a href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/">recently released v2.0</a> is a great start but the vision and the technical challenge are just so large that this new fuel will is more than welcome. We have many cool features planned and this will allow us to deliver them in a timely manner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The funding comes on the heels of <a href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/">VersionPress 2.0</a> which includes, database synchronization functionality and an updated user interface that is completely JavaScript based, along with a number of other features. In addition to funding, Bernard says talking to investors gives him a fresh perspective on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One big benefit of talking to investors is that it provides a fresh perspective on the problems one is trying to solve, how to solve them, for whom, etc. Speaking to them made us realize a couple of important things which will greatly benefit our users down the road.</p></blockquote>\n<p>VersionPress joins a growing list of WordPress products and services that have raised venture capital.

Plugin authors can take advantage of this by adding custom endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Term Metadata </strong>— Taxonomy term metadata <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/04/taxonomy-term-metadata-proposal/">is included</a> in WordPress 4.4. Developers who are using a plugin to implement term metadata should <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">read this post</a> on how to prepare for the switch. Also, the underlying <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">WP_Term class</a> improves caching when working with terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is deprecated; WordPress will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Comment</code> class improves caching and introduces strong-typing.

With <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/35294">the change</a>, plugin authors will be able to check for theme support and use a few new filters to manipulate the title. The new filters are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>''pre_get_document_title''</code> short-circuits <code>wp_get_document_title()</code> if it returns anything other than an empty value.</li>\n<li><code>''document_title_separator''</code> filters the separator between title parts.</li>\n<li><code>''document_title_parts''</code> filters the parts that make up the document title, passed in an associative array.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theme authors should no longer use <code>wp_title()</code> to generate document titles.

According to the post, Ferreira continues to play an active role encouraging women to get involved with WordPress and the technology field in Brazil:</p>\n<blockquote><p>She has worked to debunk the myth that women have no interest in WordPress and web development. She has explored why women were not participating, speaking personally with many female programmers, designers and other WordPress professionals about this important topic.

In the announcement, we recommended that other WordPress users across the globe urgently consider blocking the technology on their own web servers as well.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC in WordPress Has a Troubled Past</h2>\n<p>Days after the announcement<em>,</em> Daniel Cid, founder and CTO of Sucuri, and Mark Maunder, CEO of WordFence, <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2015/10/wordpress-xml-rpc-brute-force-attacks-amplification-multiple-logins/" target="_blank">reports</a> that a new type of Brute Force login attack was being carried out on a massive scale against WordPress sites around the world using XML-RPC. Apparently, hackers have wised up to the fact that <code>wp-login.php</code> is often well protected.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more shocking than this latest wave of attacks is that <em>they are nothing new,</em> as Sucuri previously <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/new-brute-force-attacks-exploiting-xmlrpc-in-wordpress.html">reported a similar wave of attacks</a> in July 2014. Let&#8217;s also not forget the wide-scale use of XML-RPC to perform <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html">DDoS attacks</a> on WordPress websites <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/blog/wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos.html">reported by Incapsula</a> in 2013. Combine these reports with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport%2F+xml-rpc+attack">hundreds of posts</a> on the wordpress.org support forums and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Astackoverflow.com+xml-rpc+attack">Stack Overflow</a> and a picture is painted of years of unhindered attacks against millions of WordPress sites due to this single PHP file, yikes!</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. ― Franklin D. Roosevelt</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be the one to advocate that XML-RPC be removed from WordPress but that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing: <strong>It&#8217;s time for WordPress XML-RPC to hit the road, for good.</strong></p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Was a Conscious Mistake</h2>\n<p>I understand that thousands of volunteer hours have been invested into XML-RPC support for the WordPress platform, as is the nature of open-source communities. I sincerely respect and thank said programmers and volunteers for creating a very cool way to remotely connect to a website built on WordPress. But sometimes, we need to be honest with ourselves and admit when something isn&#8217;t working; <em>This one of those times.</em></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;m framing the XML-RPC mess as a conscious mistake, <strong>that&#8217;s because it was</strong>. Three years ago, Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21509" target="_blank">announced</a> in a trac ticket that, <em>&#8220;Security is no greater a concern than the rest of core. There is no longer a compelling reason to disable [XML-RPC] by default. It’s time we should remove the option entirely.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Three years later, millions of WordPress sites have been hacked, crashed, or attacked, due to XML-RPC. It’s undeniable that removing the option to disable it (and/or enabling it by default) was wrong.</p>\n<h2>Out of Touch With the Average User</h2>\n<p>When broken down, it&#8217;s a classic case of extremely talented and intelligent software developers being out of touch with the millions of <strong>average Joes</strong> that use WordPress and have no idea what XML-RPC is. When developers inevitably argue that there are several free security plugins available that can help combat XML-RPC attacks, they completely miss the point: <u>the majority of webmasters being attacked are the same ones who don&#8217;t even know what a security plugin is or how to use it</u>.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the one good <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/" target="_blank">standalone plugin</a> that fought Brute Force login attempts was <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect" target="_blank">foolishly</a> <a href="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-protect-blocks-brute-force-amplification-attacks" target="_blank">combined</a> into the controversial Jetpack plugin, which most serious webmasters would never consider installing.</p>\n<p>The premise, of course, for XML-RPC support in WordPress is a noble idea that sounds versatile: it allows, as previously mentioned, remote connections (logins, usually) to any given domain that is running a WordPress installation. In reality, however, this XML-RPC functionality is primarily used for three common reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pingbacks/trackbacks (great for Viagra spam, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death" target="_blank">DDoS attacks</a>, and not much else)</li>\n<li>Jetpack (an all-in-one solution to <a href="http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/" target="_blank">slowing down</a> and/or bloating your WordPress site with third-party scripts)</li>\n<li>WP mobile apps (I&#8217;m not sure who blogs from their smart phone, but the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yo./id834335592" target="_blank">YO app</a> is literally rated higher than <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/wordpress/id335703880" target="_blank">WordPress</a> on the iTunes store, and the user reviews of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android" target="_blank">Android</a> version repeatedly point to XML-RPC login issues)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do recall that the WordPress backend is now responsive, which means you can login to your blog from practically any mobile device; this wasn’t the case when the native WordPress mobile apps were first launched. And arguably, the vast majority of WordPress sites have absolutely no use for pingbacks, trackbacks, or XML-RPC in general.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Needs to Be Disabled or Removed From WordPress</h2>\n<p><u>The logical conclusion should be immediately clear:</u> XML-RPC needs to die a quick death in the WordPress community, or at least be shifted into an optional (non-default) plugin or otherwise, in order to bring an immediate and measurable improvement to the security and stability of not only WordPress sites, but the internet overall.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Jeff Chandler <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks" target="_blank">said it best</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WP Tavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks. In 2010, I explained how WP Tavern was trackbacked to death. Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and I’ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects. However, I wonder if it’s time to kill them once and for all, not just on WP Tavern but in WordPress in general.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes, we as developers and others with a technical mindset get caught up in solving the challenge of the day, when what is really needed is to step back and take a more philosophical look at the bigger picture. Is this thing worth our time, or is it causing more problems than solutions? When it comes to XML-RPC in WordPress, the conclusion is obvious.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 21:33:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Post Status: Playing with type";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=14750";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://poststatus.com/playing-with-type/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8443:"<p>I am far from a typography expert, but I do love playing with type. I delight in a great reading experience, and I strongly believe typography is the key to creating a great reading experience.</p>\n<p>In my own journeys searching for and choosing typefaces for my projects, I&#8217;ve discovered some great tools, and also some pitfalls of using different delivery services.</p>\n<p>I have <a href="http://typography.com">Typography.com</a> and <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> accounts, and of course using <a href="http://google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> is very simple. Many folks also use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">Myfonts</a>, generate their own on <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Fontsquirrel</a>, self-host direct from foundries, or use a variety of other methods.</p>\n<p>When you use a font delivery service, where the font is hosted elsewhere, and you simply connect (like Typekit or Typography.com), one of the things you deal with is the authentication of your site with the service that can often cause sad delays in pageload times. Zach Tollman did a great post discussing how <a href="https://www.tollmanz.com/typography-coms-cssom-blocking-font-loader/">Typography.com in particular is not good at handling this authentication</a>, from a performance perspective.</p>\n<p>Given that I host Post Status fonts on Typography.com &#8212; I use Gotham Round, Gotham Condensed, and Sentinel here, and none of them are available anywhere else &#8212; the hit on performance perturbs me. However, I love these fonts and hate to replace them. However, I&#8217;ve lately been doing some research so I can at least test font stacks from Typekit and Google to see how big of an impact it could have.</p>\n<h3>Finding Typefaces</h3>\n<p>Finding quality typefaces is a challenge. There are <em>so many</em> out there, and the differences in quality can be vast. Part of what I love about Typography.com is that the quality of the display and cross-browser rendering is outstanding. Typekit serves typefaces from a variety of foundries, but they too have built great tools over the years to try and ensure quality rendering. Google is more of a mixed bag, though open source typefaces are getting more attention to detail in recent years than ever before.</p>\n<p>By far, my favorite tool for browsing and finding typefaces is <a href="https://www.typewolf.com">Typewolf</a>. Typewolf has PDF guides (free with your email), trending typefaces, sites of the day, and high quality recommendations on when and where to use a particular typeface. A sample resource that&#8217;s outstanding is their list of the <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/open-source-web-fonts">top 30 open source Google fonts</a>. They have many others like that. It&#8217;s definitely a must-visit site when you are considering changing up your site typography.</p>\n<p>You can also browse delivery services directly. Typekit&#8217;s <a href="https://typekit.com/lists">lists</a> are pretty good for narrowing typefaces by their intended purpose. <a href="http://justmytype.co/">Justmytype</a> is another great resource that shows recommended pairings for fonts from Typekit and Typography.com. And of course Google has filters in their directory to help narrow it down, but it&#8217;s still a bit of the wild west, so I usually rely on Googling good pairings for Google.</p>\n<h3>Tinkering with typefaces with real content</h3>\n<p>Once you find some Typefaces you like, then it&#8217;s fun to put them into practice. <a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast</a> is excellent. You can find fonts from many foundries with a free account, and do all sorts of manipulations to see the typefaces in action, using a variety of font combinations, before you move to your actual site.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14749" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/typecast-view-752x462.png" alt="typecast-view" width="752" height="462" /></p>\n<p>Beware, it&#8217;s easy to spend hours in this tool. I love that you can edit the CSS directly, and there are also tools within Typecast to insert particular types of content, so you can have a working prototype pretty quickly.</p>\n<h3>Performance implications</h3>\n<p>Loading fonts is a huge performance issue sometimes. Too many fonts, content blocking loading, time-outs from third party delivery services, and other gotchas can severely impact a site&#8217;s load times.</p>\n<p>Anytime you are looking at new typefaces to use, consider where you can serve them from, whether you can self host them, how the delivery authenticates, and potentially more &#8212; before you get your heart set.</p>\n<p>Some good rules of thumb are this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is by far the fastest, but you just don&#8217;t have access to some of the greatest font foundries this way, because all Google fonts are free.</li>\n<li>Self hosting is probably similar to or faster than serving them from Google. Most Google fonts are locally cached on lots of folks computers. Self hosting may be better for a more rare font, but for common fonts, Google may actually be faster.</li>\n<li>System fonts are always the fastest, but you might not be able to deliver your preferred typeface if the system the reader is using doesn&#8217;t support the typeface. If using system typefaces, creating thorough font stacks is a necessity. Sometimes, especially for sans-serifs, I&#8217;m tempted to just declare sans-serif, so that the system serves its favorite font &#8212; as Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, et al each have their own defaults. For serifs, I&#8217;d say just use Georgia if using system fonts only <img src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>\n<li>Typekit and Myfonts and other delivery services are usually similar in quality, but it&#8217;s one of the slowest options for delivery. Be sure to only use the weights and versions you need, and considering limiting character sets if you can get away with it.</li>\n<li>Have a performance budget for your type. Sometimes you have to make hard choices. Does your body font really need to be a non-system font? What if you just used a single display font to add the character you seek? Can you get away without italics for a certain typeface you&#8217;re using? What about bold? If you use the regular/bold/italic/bold-italic for every typeface, that adds up quickly. Use the bare minimum and add whenever you need to only.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t get too fancy, and consider your tone</h3>\n<p>My biggest mistakes over the years playing with type have been getting too fancy, especially with body copy. Simple is good with type. Especially when choosing body copy, be sure to learn about the typeface you like &#8212; and don&#8217;t just trust your own eye early on &#8212; to see if it&#8217;s an appropriate workhorse typeface.</p>\n<p>With display type, you have more leeway, but consider the mood that the typeface sets. Slabs, serifs, gothic, humanist, and other styles of type each tend to have their own tone that they set. For instance, when you read the New York Times, Georgia is a serious workhorse font, and the custom display font also sets a sober tone. Compared to Vox, for example, which uses a more casual sans-serif body copy and quite decorative display typeface. In both scenarios, readability is very good, but they set a different tone.</p>\n<h3>Learning typography takes time</h3>\n<p>Learning and understanding good typography practices takes time. Many factors are at play to make a typeface look great, and even the greatest typefaces can get screwed up when not used well.</p>\n<p>Learning best practices for things like line length, line height, pairing, and much much more can probably get you farther than what typeface you choose. And different typefaces obviously do better in different settings. The key is to take it slow, learn what you like when you are reading other websites, and see what they are doing that you are not. Also, ask your friends about your choices and get feedback; sometimes just a minor change can make a big difference, and suddenly your design clicks.</p>\n<p>We can easily be blind to our own typography mistakes. If you can limit mistakes and learn the essentials of choosing typefaces and using them well, your websites will look much, much better and your readers will be thankful, even if they never say it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:23:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"Post Status: Work life balance — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=14740";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"https://poststatus.com/work-life-balance-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1472:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a> and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not outlawed in an office to get out of your chair and do 20 jumping jacks, or plank for a minute, I definitely would feel awkward doing so. This is something on my mind as I&#8217;m working this week around ~400 colleagues for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/a8cgm">our once-a-year Grand Meetup</a>.</p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m home and have a ton of work to get through, my favorite approach is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> with 25 minutes on followed by a 5 minute break. (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12">I use this app</a> but any timer will do.) The 5 minute break is a fantastic time to do something small, like a few push-ups, squats, a plank, or even meditate.

Update your sites as soon as possible.</b></p>\n<p>A researcher from <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a> notified us of an XSS vulnerability in the Akismet WordPress plugin. This bug affects all versions of the Akismet WordPress plugin since 2.5.0, but we have no evidence that it has been exploited in the wild.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve released updates for all vulnerable versions of the Akismet plugin. Additionally, the WordPress.org plugins team has enabled an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/03/14/plugin-automatic-security-updates/">automatic update</a> for all sites running these vulnerable versions that are able to auto-update plugins.</p>\n<p>Because the vulnerability is theoretically exploitable via comments, Akismet is already blocking attempts during the comment-check API call even if you are not running the most recent version. However, to be as safe as possible, you should still upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the WordPress plugins directory</a>.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1877/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1877/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=1877&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 20:37:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Christopher Finke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: Jetpack Protect Blocks Brute Force Amplification Attacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48601";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-protect-blocks-brute-force-amplification-attacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2469:"<p>If you&#8217;ve noticed an influx of brute force attacks on your site, you&#8217;re not the only one. Sucuri <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html">is reporting</a> that brute force amplification attacks are targeting WordPress sites with XML-RPC enabled. In a nutshell, XML-RPC contains a system.multicall method which allows developers to execute multiple methods and commands inside a single request.</p>\n<h2>What is a Brute Force Amplification Attack?</h2>\n<p>In a typical brute force attack, several machines or bots try to guess the username and password for a site one  at a time. In a brute force amplification attack, attackers can guess hundreds or thousands of combinations within a single request making the attack more efficient and difficult to block.</p>\n<p>The XML-RPC protocol in WordPress is a communications bridge between remote applications such as the WordPress mobile apps and the site itself. It&#8217;s also used to communicate and authenticate to Jetpack.</p>\n<h2>Jetpack Protect Does Its Job</h2>\n<p>Jetpack comes with a module called <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/security-features/">Jetpack Protect</a> formerly <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect">known as BruteProtect</a>, that protects sites from brute force attacks. Sam Hotchkiss, lead developer of Jetpack Protect, <a href="https://samhotchkiss.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/testing-for-xml-rpc-multicall-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress/">confirms in a blog post</a> that Jetpack Protect blocks brute force amplification attacks out-of-the box.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our testing, we confirmed that Jetpack Protect (and BruteProtect) do block this attack vector.  If you’re running Jetpack with Protect enabled or you’re running BruteProtect, you don’t need to do anything to keep yourself safe from this attack technique.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you use Jetpack Protect, you don&#8217;t need to do anything to block this attack vector. For everyone else, Sucuri recommends that administrators block system.multicall requests as they&#8217;re not used much in the wild. There&#8217;s also a handful of security plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">iThemes Security</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/">WordPress Simple Firewall</a> that block system.multicalls and can disable XML-RPC.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 18:24:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: What Do You Want to See in a WordPress.tv Redesign?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48595";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-a-wordpress-tv-redesign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1693:"<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a> team is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tv/2015/10/08/building-a-better-wordpress-tv-functional-requirements/">requesting feedback</a> on what features you&#8217;d like to see in a website redesign. Jerry Bates, volunteer moderator for WordPress.tv, says one of the goals for 2016 is to update the site to better showcase content from WordCamps around the world.

Many of the comments don&#8217;t link to or provide data that backs up their claim.</p>\n<p>Outside of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/benchmarks-indicate-jetpack-doesnt-negatively-impact-site-loading-times">benchmarks</a> produced by the BruteProtect team late last year, there&#8217;s little evidence to support the claim that Jetpack negatively impacts a site&#8217;s performance. <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/#content-plugins">Arūnas Liuiza</a>, a WordPress plugin developer, is working <a href="http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/">on a new project</a> that hopes to solve the mystery of whether or not Jetpack causes sites to load more slowly.</p>\n<h2>Preparing the Testing Environment</h2>\n<p>In the next few weeks, Liuiza and his students will scour the WordPress plugin directory to find plugins with comparable features to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. The team is going to set up three identical WordPress sites with default Lorem Ipsum content.</p>\n<p>One site will act as the benchmark, another will run Jetpack, and the third will run plugins similar to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. Liuiza explains how his students will perform the benchmark process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ll start the measuring, with different plugins/modules activated and deactivated. We’ll be doing 1-to-1 comparisons, as well as some combos. We are going to measure load times, as well as some stats reported by Query Monitor such as memory usage, database query count etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Liuiza says benchmark results will be published in a series of posts on his blog and on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/">Advanced WordPress Facbook group</a>. Liuiza is asking for the community&#8217;s help to locate plugins that are feature-comparable to the modules in Jetpack.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s also asking for advice on the testing methodology he and his students should use.

The company has also created a Platform Engineer position and although it&#8217;s not hiring to fill the role, the company has left the title open-ended as it continues to support and build web platforms such as <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2015/sponsoring-sanitize-css/">santize.css</a> and <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>.</p>\n<h2>Sponsoring Scott Kingsley Clark to Work on the Fields API Project</h2>\n<p>In a major show of support, 10up is sponsoring 100 hours of <a href="http://scottkclark.com/">Scott Kingsley Clark’s</a> company time to work on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/">Fields API Project</a>. Announced in May, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/">Fields API Project</a> is an offshoot of the Metadata API project. The Fields API would allow developers to register fields and sections for WordPress objects. According to Clark, the goal is to initially cover the following WordPress objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizer (retrofitting it beneath the existing Customizer API)</li>\n<li>User profile screen</li>\n<li>Post editor</li>\n<li>Settings screens (retrofitting it beneath the existing Settings API)</li>\n<li>And other areas in the future (Comment editor, Network Settings screens [see <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15691">#15691</a>], Media modals, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10up believes that supporting the Fields API Project will help move it into a viable state to potentially be added to WordPress in the near-future, &#8220;As a company with a central mission of creating great publishing experiences, the user and developer experiences a fields API can improve are something we are particularly well-versed in,&#8221; Hou-Sandi said.</p>\n<p>Hou-Sandi goes on to explain that the web is built on open technologies that are usually maintained by small groups of people who rely on donations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The balance between use and support of open source software leans heavily toward use, and that imbalance has become even more apparent. Even with increased awareness around the plight of projects integral to a safe web, initiatives like OpenSSL continue to operate on small donations and the volunteer efforts of a few. It takes time to convert pledges into action, and we’ve yet to see very many pledges at all, much less action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following quote written by Jake Goldman, <a href="http://10up.com/about/#employee-jake-goldman">Founder and President of 10up</a>, explains why reinvesting in open source projects is so important not only for his company&#8217;s customers, but the WordPress userbase in general.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve said repeatedly that nothing is more critical to the success of agencies that rely on community, open source software platforms than the continued success of those platforms. It is incumbent upon those who have leveraged free, open platforms with success to share that success back.</p>\n<p>By economically enabling world-class engineers to improve open platforms, we not only ensure that our customers continue to have a first class solution, we enable the next generation of builders, who can’t yet afford such resources, to further grow our ecosystem and the platform’s demand. I believe this is the social contract of open source, and as 10up grows, so to will our contributions to open source. It’s not just responsible citizenship, it’s good business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It makes sense for companies whose businesses rely on open source software to find ways to reinvest time, energy, and money back into those projects less they disappear. That&#8217;s precisely what 10up is doing along with <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">a few other companies</a>.

Unlike the plugin browser in WordPress, the browser on WordPress.com displays new plugins.</p>\n<p>Both browsers display similar information in the detailed view with the exception that the WordPress.com browser doesn&#8217;t show a list of contributors. Enej Bajgorić, a member of the Jetpack development team, explains how to quickly install a plugin to a Jetpack site when browsing the WordPress plugin directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you find yourself browsing the WordPress.org plugin repository and want to install the plugin on your Jetpack site, you can just replace the .org in the URL with .com and be taken to the new Plugin Browser where you can install the plugin with a single click. You will need to be logged into your WordPress.com account for this to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A plugin browser to search for and install plugins is another feature that makes Jetpack Manage a free, decent alternative to commercial services for managing multiple sites.

Tom is a <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/vip-wrangler/">VIP Wrangler</a> at <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com">WordPress.com VIP</a>, lead of the <a href="http://www.wptherightway.org/en/index.html">WP The Right Way</a> project, <a href="http://tomjn.com">blogger</a>, and community moderator at <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/">WordPress Stack Exchange</a>. Tom will be speaking at <a href="https://nyc.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp New York</a> later this month on escaping and security.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This is a story about my job as a <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com" target="_blank">VIP Wrangler</a>, what <a href="http://automattic.com" target="_blank">Automattic</a> does to keep Automatticians happy, and my battles with anxiety, <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html" target="_blank">depression</a>, and fear.</p>\n<h2>Joining the VIP Team</h2>\n<p>Almost a year ago, I worked for <a href="http://codeforthepeople.com/">Code For The People</a>, a six person development agency that was in acquisition talks with Automattic. I remember at the beginning of the week, we thought an acquisition could happen before Christmas and by the following Friday, we were signing new employment contracts, and booking tickets to Lisbon for the VIP team meet up!</p>\n<p>I remember being the first to arrive, surrounded by people from the VIP team I&#8217;ve never met in person. We went out for dinner, learned how to do deploys, visited aquariums, gardens, and then went home.</p>\n<h2>The Happiness Rotation</h2>\n<p>After the meet up, I spent two months finishing contracts and started my Happiness Rotation. A happiness rotation is three weeks of working on the WordPress.com support team to get in touch with the problems end users are facing. Every Automattician has to go through a happiness rotation as part of their trial.</p>\n<p>Working the happiness rotation was hard. When I say this, I don&#8217;t mean it was an insurmountable task. I had a full-time Happiness Engineer available 24/7 to ask any question I wanted, a week of walkthroughs, supervised working, mountains of documentation, pre-written examples, and slack channels with friendly supportive people. I knew what to do, how to do it, and <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/736/tom-j-nowell" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve done it before</a>.</p>\n<h2>VIP Training</h2>\n<p>Despite this, I struggled, and VIP training began. Work at VIP fits into several sub roles that developers cycle through and training consists of a week in each role mentored by an experienced VIP Wrangler. Afterwards, we continue the cycle as full VIP Wranglers. Throughout the entire process, I had a general mentor for any and all things Automattic, be it mystery acronyms, or how to book a holiday.</p>\n<p>At this point, I realized my job had grown in scope and felt insurmountable. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on and there was still much to learn. Combined with a torrent of new notifications, p2s, and emails, I felt lost. GitHub scaled from two to three emails per day to hundreds, P2 posts filled my other inbox, people asked difficult questions, and the sheer amount of activity at Automattic was overwhelming.</p>\n<h2>Dealing With Adversity</h2>\n<p>In the last few years, I viewed Automattic as my career end goal and suddenly I was there, years ahead of schedule. Not just that, I was struggling. I couldn&#8217;t grasp what was going on and I felt paralyzed in the face of work. I grappled with the thought that I was bad at my job, didn&#8217;t belong there, and that I wouldn&#8217;t last the next six months. I had this feeling that at any time, they were going to pull me into a call and say it isn&#8217;t working out.</p>\n<p>A number of questions ran through my head. What would people think if they saw I left after the acquisition? Everyone&#8217;s treating it as a promotion and congratulating me. Maybe I&#8217;m not ready? I was handed a theme to review and struggling to read basic lines of code, mulling it over in my mind, why can&#8217;t I do this?</p>\n<p>Sometimes I had the wrong window open and was reviewing my code but was so preoccupied, I didn&#8217;t realize it. Today, it takes me four days to review 6,000 lines of code in a theme but at the time, it took me two weeks to move through 1,000 lines.</p>\n<h2>The Catch Up Calls</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s at this point that I was introduced to the bi-weekly catch up call. The team leads would chat with each person individually every two weeks to find out how they were, what they were doing, and what they&#8217;d like to do the following week. It was a chance to flag any problems and plan ahead.</p>\n<p>I experienced nothing like this at CFTP or at any of my previous jobs and combined with the stalling work on the review, I panicked. My first catch up call was awkward and didn&#8217;t last long. My second catch up call didn&#8217;t go so well. I was at WordCamp Norway preparing to give a talk on <a href="http://www.wptherightway.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">WP The Right Way</a>. I sat in a quiet room and received a call on a Skype from my team lead.</p>\n<p>I felt as though I was put on the spot having to justify what I&#8217;d been doing the last two weeks, and trying to figure out how to spin weeks of panicking in front of a computer into a tale of bountiful code reviewing, pleasant Norwegian winters, and a smile.</p>\n<h2>Recovering From the Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Instead, I closed my machine and burst into tears. A few minutes later I opened my machine, apologized, and tried to explain what had happened. I was told they didn&#8217;t care how much work I was doing as long as I was learning and happy. A colleague picked up the review I was working on and noted that I was  thorough with the parts I reviewed.</p>\n<p>My team lead, Steph, checked up on me every two to three days for the next two weeks to make sure I was okay and tried to find what kind of work I took to best. I spent time on deploys, then moved on to a long rotation doing code review so that I could focus on particular tasks and build my confidence.</p>\n<p>While this was happening, another colleague asked if I was okay as he thought I was down. He introduced me to an internal slack channel called <a href="http://bluehackers.org/" target="_blank">Bluehackers</a> where other Automatticians who struggled could share their experiences. Seeing other people talk candidly about their problems made me recognize a lot of things I hadn&#8217;t considered, the most important being that I wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>\n<h2>I&#8217;m Not Alone</h2>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only one who struggled some days and failed to get anything done. I wasn&#8217;t the only one who panicked when faced with new or even familiar tasks. Everyone at VIP was friendly and supportive, not because they knew of my situation, but because they are nice people. One time, my technical lead sent me three family sized pies because we had a slack discussion on pudding.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t get anything done. Sometimes I struggle to do things I normally do effortlessly. Sometimes I turn off the video in calls because I&#8217;m still in bed. It&#8217;s 3PM and I can&#8217;t bring myself to get up, changed, and eat. There are so many projects I want to do. I have the knowledge, I have the resources, the support, the time, but they don&#8217;t get done, and it&#8217;s a struggle to explain why. Sometimes it&#8217;s things I know that need doing, like buying food or paying bills.</p>\n<h2>Confirmation Things are Working Out</h2>\n<p>A few months later I was in Seville at WordCamp Europe. Initially, I wasn&#8217;t going to go but decided I would regret it if I didn&#8217;t. I threw some clothes in a suitcase and purchased a flight. Large groups of people are scary, but I&#8217;ve found WordCamps tend to have familiar friendly faces mixed in. I can&#8217;t stress how big a boost it is to be able to see and make friends from event to event, yet still meet new people.</p>\n<p>Before I left, I found myself with my former boss and now colleague. He asked how I was getting along at Automattic. He asked me this before, and I said, &#8220;It was rough at the start but I think I&#8217;m there now.&#8221; He told me that everyone else at the company thought good of me and that I was fitting in well. It might have been simple statement but it meant a lot to me.</p>\n<h2>A Bout of Impostor Syndrome</h2>\n<p>I had real moments when I went to sleep thinking I was going to lose my job, that I might not be cut out to be a developer, and that I didn&#8217;t deserve the things I had. But throughout the entire process, my team leads and my colleagues tried to support me. They placed my well-being first and they proactively asked if I was ok when they suspected something was wrong, and sought to put real solutions in place where they could.</p>\n<p>They found other people with similar problems and tried to give me the ability to express what was happening, sharing their own problems coping, and what they were doing to keep on top of them. They gave praise and listened to good ideas, asked for help when they needed it, and they understood. Right now, I&#8217;m ok, but things have a habit of creeping up unnoticed, triggered by unexpected things.</p>\n<p>I get anxious about food at WordCamps if I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s being served, I&#8217;m uncomfortable in social situations, and at times I have problems gathering the energy to do day-to-day things, but I&#8217;m lucky. I have a good job, a nice family, a comfortable apartment, and interesting work. My problems are mild and I know others have it worse. Most people are going to pretend everything&#8217;s ok but everyone needs a little help.</p>\n<h2>Suggestions for Employers and Struggling Employees</h2>\n<p>Automattic has things in place to make sure Automatticians lead healthy mental lives. We have an unlimited holiday allowance, a small expense budget to make traveling easier (e.g. a pot of tea at an airport or a massage), team meet ups, sabbaticals, and many others. Matt Mullenweg doesn&#8217;t want Automatticians to struggle, we work hard and it takes its toll. Often, we forget that we have to take care of our emotional and mental needs and give ourselves time.</p>\n<p>Consider creating your own internal Bluehackers group and give people avenues to express themselves when they need to. Make sure they&#8217;re happy, and that you care about their well-being more than their quality of work and output as reassurance goes a long way. Some companies have gone as far as setting minimum holiday allowances to force employees to spend time on themselves.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re dealing with problems like these, talk about it. Talk to a GP/Doctor, a friend, family, whatever works for you. Talking is hard, but it&#8217;s necessary. If someone opens up to you, listen. Don&#8217;t try to offer solutions, don&#8217;t compare and contrast, don&#8217;t try to offer sympathy, don&#8217;t expect it to be sorted out in a month&#8217;s time. Simply listen as that person chose to tell you, so give them space and respect.</p>\n<p>If you suspect someone is down, ask them if they&#8217;re ok and if you notice they bounce back, tell them, and tell them you&#8217;re glad! Highlight interesting things that happen, help them when they make a mistake, ask them when you make one yourself. But remember, sometimes all someone needs is a hug and a cup of tea to know that things are ok. Give them space, don&#8217;t ask for explanations, and let them know you&#8217;re there if you need them.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 17:11:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"Post Status: How WordPress core development happens — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=14528";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"https://poststatus.com/how-wordpress-core-development-happens-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2409:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a> and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Since launching in 2008, Hesketh&#8217;s videos have been viewed more than a million times by over 500k people. He&#8217;s also re-recorded the videos that make up the WP101 series 17 times. With seven years of experience under his belt, I asked Hesketh what he would have done differently in the beginning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From a technical standpoint, I wish I’d picked a solid membership plugin that would have enabled us to grow. We’re planning a costly migration in the coming months, and a better membership plugin might have saved us the considerable hassle and cost,&#8221; Hesketh told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Technical issues aside, Hesketh believes his business&#8217; success is largely due to his focus on serving people, &#8220;It’s one thing to create an online course and hope people discover it. But it takes much more dedication to actually engage people on a daily basis, take the time to understand their goals, and then help them get clear on how to accomplish those goals,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Hesketh doesn&#8217;t have any regrets but wishes he launched the question and answer forum on the first day, &#8220;Its given me the opportunity to answer questions that may not be covered in our videos. That’s the real value that WP101 brings to the table, real people helping others,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WP101 launched around the same time as a lot of commercial theme shops such as iThemes, StudioPress, and WooThemes. Although WP101 doesn&#8217;t sell commercial themes or plugins, Hesketh has carved out a space in the WordPress ecosystem that enables him to make a living. If you use WP101 or have in the past, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of his videos in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Oct 2015 01:33:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: The Top 100 Active WordPress Themes and Plugins on GoDaddy’s Hosting Network";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48462";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://wptavern.com/the-top-100-active-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-on-godaddys-hosting-network";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5167:"<p>It was a warm, sunny afternoon in Tempe, AZ as I walked with a group of GoDaddy employees on our way to lunch during Pressnomics 3 earlier this year. It&#8217;s the first time I met Mendel Kurland, Christopher Carfi, and Kurt Payne in person. During lunch, we discussed a number of topics from the efforts made to change the company&#8217;s image, to ideas that help the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>I suggested to the team that GoDaddy create a billboard chart that shows the most popular themes and plugins used across its network. Not only would the information be beneficial to the company, it would also give the WordPress community valuable insight into what plugins and themes are used on a webhosting network with millions of customers.</p>\n<p>Nine months after our discussion, GoDaddy turned the idea into reality with the <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/wordpress-hot-100/">Hot 100</a>.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GoDaddyHot100.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48463" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GoDaddyHot100.png?resize=1025%2C682" alt="Top 100 Plugins and Themes of The Week" /></a>Top 100 Plugins and Themes of The Week\n<p>GoDaddy tracks which themes and plugins are activated across the millions of sites it hosts and puts the 100 most popular of each into a list. The list is generated each week and places the previous week of results into an archive allowing you to monitor trends.</p>\n<p>Similar to the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">Billboard Hot 100</a>, you can see the current rank of a plugin or theme, whether it&#8217;s moved up or down, and what its rank was the previous week. With an influential list like the Hot 100, it would be easy to accept paid listings. Carfi, confirms <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/webpro/wordpress/hot-100-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/">it&#8217;s not possible</a> to purchase placement.</p>\n<h2>How the Lists Are Generated</h2>\n<p>The Hot 100 is determined by ranking the net change in the number of active installs of WordPress plugins and themes in aggregate across GoDaddy&#8217;s hosting network. It looks at plugins and themes that are active at the time of the analysis and does not include plugins or themes that are deactivated.</p>\n<p>Instead of using the total number of active installs, the Hot 100 looks at the week-over-week change in active installs. This enables the list to determine which plugins and themes are hot or part of a rising trend. It also prevents bias towards plugins that already have a large install base such as Jetpack.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, themes on the list that are non-GPL are specifically noted and link to the Hot 100 instead of their corresponding theme page. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1025849944143886/">post published</a> to the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, Jeff King, Senior Vice President of Hosting at GoDaddy explains why.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One great recommendation and valuable bit of feedback we received is that, since the community embraces GPL, we should reflect that ethos in the Hot 100 list. While some non-GPL themes or plugins may occasionally show up in the list due to the fact that some non-GPL items still exist in the ecosystem, we don&#8217;t necessarily need to link to them. As of next week, we&#8217;ll be removing links to non-GPL themes and plugins.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The Hot 100 Is a Valuable Resource</h2>\n<p>Although WordPress.org provides stats for plugin and theme authors, you can&#8217;t determine where they&#8217;re being used. The GoDaddy Hot 100 gives the public and developers of popular plugins and themes an opportunity to see how well they&#8217;re doing on one of the largest webhosts in the industry. While Jetpack and Akismet are the two most active plugins and seven default themes make up the top 10 themes, it&#8217;s the 25th-100th rankings that I find interesting.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a> which ships with WordPress and is activated by default after installation is ranked 27th this week. Last week, it ranked 38th meaning a lot of new installs of WordPress have taken place. This indicates that even though a lot of customers disable the plugin at some point after installation, it remains active on many sites hosted by GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>One of the largest jumps I&#8217;ve seen so far is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/">Image Widget</a> plugin by Modern Tribe. It was ranked 95th last week and 31st this week. It would be interesting to know why a lot of new WordPress installs are activating this plugin on GoDaddy hosted sites this week versus last week.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/wordpress-hot-100/">Hot 100</a> is a valuable resource and I encourage you to see if your favorite plugins and themes made the list. Although it&#8217;s specific to GoDaddy, do you think the data is valuable? Would you like to see other large webhosting companies provide a glimpse into the most active WordPress themes and plugins used across their network?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Oct 2015 18:51:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7.2 Patches Two Security Vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48458";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-2-patches-two-security-vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1336:"<p>Jetpack 3.7.2 is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">available for download</a> and patches two security vulnerabilities.

In this post, I highlight six plugins that solve a problem I encountered or enhance comments for both readers and site administrators. All of the plugins are free of charge and available from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.</p>\n<h2>Problem Solvers</h2>\n<h3>Crowd Control</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48420" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png?resize=799%2C253" alt="Crowd Control Plugin Banner" /></a>I discovered that not all comments need to be moderated. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/crowd-control/">Crowd Control</a>, by Postmatic, gives readers the ability to report comments they feel don&#8217;t adhere to a site&#8217;s commenting policy.</p>\n<p>When enabled, a new option is displayed on the <strong>General &#8211; Discussion</strong> settings page. You can configure how many reports a comment needs before it&#8217;s sent to the moderation queue and whether administrators should be notified when it happens.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48421" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png?resize=798%2C174" alt="Crowd Control Settings" /></a>Crowd Control Settings\n<p>If an administrator approves a comment that&#8217;s in moderation due to hitting the threshold, it won&#8217;t end up back in the moderation queue. This gives administrators the last word on whether a comment is acceptable or not.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48422" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png?resize=686%2C202" alt="Crowd Control in Action" /></a>Crowd Control in Action\n<p>If you think a comment needs an administrator&#8217;s attention or does not adhere to the WP Tavern <a href="http://wptavern.com/comment-policy">commenting policy</a>, hover over the comment and click the report button. A new column is added to <strong>edit-comments.php</strong> that displays how many reports a comment has. It&#8217;s important to note that detailed information of who reported the comment is not saved to the database.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48423" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png?resize=807%2C193" alt="Reported Comments Column" /></a>Reported Comments Column\n<p>The system is open for abuse but I trust that the Tavern readership will use it responsibly.</p>\n<h3>Show Parent Comment</h3>\n<p>Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/">Show Parent Comment</a>, developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stephencronin/">Stephen Cronin</a>, adds a <strong>Show More</strong> dropdown to the <strong>edit-comments.php</strong> screen that allows administrators to see the text of the comment that a person is responding too.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a><br />\nI&#8217;ve used this plugin for more than two weeks and I enjoy the user interface. It looks and acts as if it&#8217;s a natural part of WordPress. Chris Christoff <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33627">created a ticket</a> in Trac with the suggestion that a user interface element like the one in Cronin&#8217;s plugin be added to core. If you have feedback on the best way to accomplish this, please add it to the ticket.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements to Native Comments</h2>\n<h3>Epoch</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48415" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png?resize=806%2C255" alt="Epoch Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/">Epoch</a> is a plugin developed by Postmatic and a few other contributors that enhances WordPress&#8217; comment system. Unlike services such as Disqus or Livefyre that replace the comment system, Epoch adds features to WordPress&#8217; native comments. This allows you to keep comments within your database at all times without relying on a third-party.</p>\n<p>Epoch applies a series of visual enhancements to the comment form. Replies from the post author are a different color from regular responses and the date and time the comment is written is displayed at the top. Epoch also uses Ajax to send and receive comments which eliminates the need to refresh the page.</p>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-2-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<p>Epoch has a front end moderation capability that allows site administrators to approve, trash, or spam comments. Unlike the native comment form, Epoch doesn&#8217;t load the comments unless the browser reaches a certain point on a post or is accessed via a direct link.</p>\n<p>In most instances, the comment form loads quickly but on certain mobile devices, the lack of speed is noticeable. The team is aware of the performance issues and is attacking the problem with a three stage approach.</p>\n<p>Epoch relies on JavaScript to function so if a visitor browsing your site has JavaScript disabled, the comments don&#8217;t load. Again, the team is aware of this issue and is creating a fallback to WordPress&#8217; native comment system if the files can&#8217;t be retrieved from its CDN or JavaScript is disabled.</p>\n<h3>Basic Comment Quicktags</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48426" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png?resize=769%2C251" alt="Basic Comment Quicktag Plugin Banner" /></a>In WordPress 4.3, the allowed HTML tags text displayed near the comment form <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30157">was removed</a>. The tags were removed because they&#8217;re note relevant and confusing to most users. While I agree that the text is not relevant, I think the comment form should have basic text formatting buttons so readers don&#8217;t have to remember and manually type HTML tags.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48428" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png?resize=665%2C368" alt="Basic Comment Quicktags in Action" /></a>Basic Comment Quicktags in Action\n<p>Once Basic Comment Quicktags is installed, navigate to <strong>Settings &#8211; Discussion</strong> and check the box to enable them for comments. When enabled, the comment text area will have Bold, Italic, Link and Quote buttons. The best part of this plugin is that it exposes a built-in core feature using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API">Quicktags API</a> added to WordPress 3.3. Text formatting buttons in the comment area is a courtesy I&#8217;d like more site owners to give to readers.</p>\n<h3>Simple Comment Editing</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48429" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png?resize=764%2C262" alt="Simple Comment Editing Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a>, developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ronalfy/">Ronald Huereca</a>, adds the ability for readers to edit their comments in a limited time frame. By default, readers have five minutes to edit their comment once it&#8217;s submitted. Although no configuration is necessary, you can alter the time and behavior of the plugin by using <a href="https://github.com/ronalfy/simple-comment-editing#wordpress-filters">actions and filters</a>. I&#8217;ve changed the time limit to 15 minutes on the Tavern to make sure readers have plenty of time to make edits.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48430" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png?resize=676%2C173" alt="Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer" /></a>Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer\n<p>With Simple Comment Editing installed, the amount of contact form submissions and requests to edit a comment have gone down considerably.</p>\n<h3>Postmatic</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48432" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png?resize=801%2C235" alt="Postmatic Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/">Postmatic</a> is a plugin that <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/">ties into a service</a> and has a number of features. Readers can subscribe to posts or to comments and receive updates via email. Postmatic has a beautiful email template that shows the most recent reply, the commenter&#8217;s Gravatar, and a recap of the post and conversation.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48433" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png?resize=727%2C833" alt="Postmatic Comment Email Template" /></a>Postmatic Comment Email Template\n<p>Readers can respond to comments via email without having to visit the comment form. Site administrators can reply, trash, or submit comments to Akismet via email. It&#8217;s important to note that Postmatic is not a third-party commenting service. Instead, it uses the native comment system in WordPress allowing you to keep and own your data at all times.</p>\n<p>While I moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app or the WordPress backend, Postmatic is a great fallback. I also think the email template looks great and offers a better user experience than the comment notification emails provided by WordPress. Postmatic <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/technology/">does a lot more</a> than what I describe above but for the purpose of this article, I focused on the comment portion of the service.</p>\n<p>Postmatic is a new addition to the Tavern that I encourage you to try. After trying it out, please tell me about your experience. I especially wany to know if it&#8217;s easier to keep track of and take part in conversations.</p>\n<h2 class="font-headlines">Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved</h2>\n<p>One of the problems I&#8217;ve yet to solve is being addressed by a number of WordPress contributors in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717#comment:6">ticket 33717</a>. If all goes well, it&#8217;s possible this feature will be added to WordPress 4.4. Once added, readers whose comments end up in the moderation queue will automatically be notified by WordPress when it&#8217;s approved.</p>\n<h2>It’s Not Perfect but It&#8217;s an Improvement</h2>\n<p>Even with all the features these plugins provide, I don&#8217;t think the comment system in WordPress or the form on WP Tavern is perfect. I&#8217;m not sure if perfection of either can be achieved. However, I think both are improvements over the previous iterations. If there&#8217;s a plugin you use to improve WordPress&#8217; native comments or its moderation system, let me know about it in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Oct 2015 08:28:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"Donncha: The Web Won’t Forget Alex King";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://z9.io/?p=89499737";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://z9.io/2015/09/29/the-web-wont-forget-alex-king/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2811:"<p>If you use a WordPress site, either as a visitor or owner, you&#8217;re using code that <a href="http://alexking.org/">Alex King</a>, one of the original developers of WordPress, worked on. </p>\n<p>He passed away after fighting <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer">cancer for 2 years</a> but his online presence lives on in the form of his blog with it&#8217;s deep archive of posts going back years, and in so much code that it&#8217;s humbling to look at his <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a>.

In the ticket, Scribu explains that the View Post button is redundant functionality and suggests that it be removed in favor of a clickable permalink.</p>\n<p>Here are two screenshots of the post editor. The first is WordPress 4.3 and the second is WordPress 4.4. Clicking the permalink allows you to preview the post in its current state. Notice the slug part of the URL is in bold.

Alex actually <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2002/10/24/b2-coding">got involved with b2 in 2002</a> and was active in the forums and the &#8220;hacks&#8221; community there.</p>\n<p>Alex had a background as a designer before he learned development, and I think that really came through as he was one of those rare people who thought about the design and usability of his code, the opposite of most development that drifts toward entropy and complexity. One of my favorite things about Alex was how <em>darn tasteful</em> he was. He would think about every aspect of something he built, every place someone could click, every path they could go down, and gave a thoughtfulness to these paths that I still admire and envy today.</p>\n<p>As an example look&nbsp;at his <a href="http://alexking.org/project/post-formats-admin-ui">project page (essentially a category archive) for the Post Formats Admin UI</a>, isn&#8217;t that clever and intuitive how the posts connect together, and when more time passes in the thread it&#8217;s <a href="https://cloudup.com/ceWJeb9zcK6">shown as a break</a>. It&#8217;s classic Alex: something simple and thoughtful that in hindsight is so gobsmackingly obvious you wonder why everything doesn&#8217;t work that way, but you never would have imagined it beforehand. And Alex wouldn&#8217;t just imagine it and do it for himself, he released his best work as open source, as a gift to the community and the world, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>Back when WordPress was getting started Alex was a celebrity of the b2 world, his hacks (plugins before plugins) were&nbsp;some of the coolest ones around. We had a ton of overlapping interests in web standards, photography, development, and gadgets so&nbsp;we frequently read and commented on each other&#8217;s blogs. I would never miss a post on his site, and that&#8217;s back when we were both doing one or more posts a day. To get a sense of Alex it&#8217;s worth <a href="http://alexking.org/blog">exploring his blog</a> &#8212; he was a clear thinker and therefore a clear writer.&nbsp;The straightforward nature Alex wrote with was something I always admired about him.</p>\n<p>We <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/08/wordpress-development">discussed WordPress early on</a>, Alex <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks">signed up to help with what later became the plugin directory</a>, and <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition">his CSS competition</a> (look at those prizes! and notice it&#8217;s all GPL) was hugely influential on the path to themes, and <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/08/15/wordpress-dev">he officially became a contributing developer in August of 2003</a>.</p>\n<p>The list of what Alex was one of the first to do in the WordPress community is long, and <em>in hindsight</em> seems gobsmackingly obvious, which is the sign of innovation. I smile when I think of how he <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/10/02/moving-to-denver">moved from the Bay area to Denver</a> before it was cool, or his <a href="https://cloudup.com/cL9v2RKEI0T">love of scare quotes</a>. Once there was something going on in WordPress and he called me to talk about it, I was so surprised, he said the number was right on my contact page (and it was) but even though it had been there for years no one had ever called it before, but that was just the type of person Alex was, always reaching out and connecting.</p>\n<p><img src="https://atow.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2007-04-16_2122-18_8683.jpg" alt="" /></p>\n<p><em>Adam Tow, myself, Barry Abrahamson, Alex King; Photo from <a href="http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/">Adam Tow&#8217;s post</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to include this next part: I couldn&#8217;t write last night &#8212; I was too tired. After falling&nbsp;asleep I had one of those super vivid dreams that you can&#8217;t tell are dreams. There had been some sort of mix-up on Twitter and Alex was still alive, I&nbsp;visited Colorado with my sister and saw him surrounded by family at a picnic table, all the rooms were taken so they put me on a floor mattress where I slept. Tons of his friends were around and we took pictures together, he was excited about the better front&nbsp;camera on the 6s+. (Alex understood&nbsp;mobile all the way back to the Treo days.) It was all very ordinary and in a group setting, until we decided to walk alongside a small highway, past some grain silos, to meet the group at a bar. The walk was just the two of us and we talked and&nbsp;laughed about the big mix-up and he asked about this post, what was going to be in it. He got most excited and emphatic with the part about him being a developer with great taste, and a clear writer <a href="http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/">William Zinsser</a> would be proud of, so I like to think that those were two things he was proud of. The overwhelming emotion I remember was joy. Waking up was disconcerting, part of me wants to believe part of Alex&#8217;s spirit was there, where another more logical part thinks my mind was&nbsp;just going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">the denial stage of grief</a>. Regardless I know that Alex will stay in the minds of people who knew him for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Code that Alex wrote still runs billions of times a day across millions of websites, and long after that code evolves or gets refactored the ideas and philosophy he embedded in WordPress will continue to be part of who we are. Alex believed so deeply in open source, and was one of the few people from a design background who did. (Every time you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_icon">the share icon</a> on the web or in Android you should think of him.) I like the idea that part of his work will&nbsp;continue in software for decades to come, but I&#8217;d rather have him here, thinking outside the box and challenging us to do better, to be more obvious, and work harder for our users. He never gave up.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 17:57:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: Alex King, Founder of Crowd Favorite Passes Away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48380";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8966:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-48381" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg?resize=620%2C360" alt="Alex King with his daughter Heather" /></a>Alex King with his daughter Caitlin\n<p>Alex King, who founded web development agency <a href="https://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite,</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/">author</a> of several WordPress themes and plugins <a href="http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/">passed away last night</a> at his home. In January 2013, King was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. He used his blog to tell the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer">story of his fight to stay alive</a>.</p>\n<p>On August 24th, King <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/cycle-1-of-new-trial">finished the first cycle</a> of a new clinical trial that he says went well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m nearly through my first cycle of the new clinical trial and overall I think it’s gone pretty well.

King requested that anyone with memories of him and his career to submit them to his wife.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult.

He&#8217;s one of the earliest WordPress developers and is largely credited with motivating developers to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%203/12-themes.md">build themes</a> using the template engine in WordPress 1.5.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex King wrote a <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher">CSS Style Switcher</a> hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. Users needed a pool of stylesheets to choose from. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition">CSS Style competition</a>. Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10 respectively. &#8211; WordPress History Book</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the first contest, King received 38 submissions with Pink Lillies by Naoko Takano winning first place.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-48383" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png?resize=500%2C300" alt="Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest" /></a>Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest\n<p>Each sylesheet submitted to the contest was <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles">available to the public</a>. In essence, King&#8217;s website was an early version of the WordPress theme directory. In the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition">second contest</a>, he received over 100 submissions. In total, King hosted 138 themes on his site. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of work required.</p>\n<h2>Appearances</h2>\n<p>King appeared on several different WordPress podcasts and spoke at a number of WordCamps.

A group of us rode together in a party limo complete with blinking lights inside. I sat across from him and asked a few questions related to his health. I also asked him about the early days of WordPress.

It will help your site run faster and serve more traffic.</p>\n<p>This is a security and bugfix release.\n<ul>\n<li>Some servers display a directory index when no index.html is found in a directory. That may reveal the filenames of cache files.</li>\n<li> There were issues in the settings page that might allow an attacker to browse or delete files named index.html.</li>\n<li> PHP Object Injection could occur if an attacker managed to inject malicious code into the legacy cache meta files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you upgrade, your “legacy cache” files for logged in users will be deleted. This may have an impact on your site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your site is slow at generating new pages.</li>\n<li>If you have many known users (logged in users or people who comment).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your site will suddenly have to generate new cache files for all visiting known users.</p>\n<p>Relying on caching like this is not recommended for these types of users as it’s very inefficient. Each user has a separate cache file that must be checked whenever the plugin does administration work like cleaning up stale cache files.</p>\n<p>If most of your traffic is anonymous users who don’t comment you don’t need to worry about this.</p>\n<h3>Directory Listings</h3>\n<p>If a server is configured to show directory listings it will show files and directories in the cache directory to visitors who access those directories directly through their browser. This might reveal private posts, and in the case where legacy caching is enabled for known users the login cookie was stored in &#8220;.meta&#8221; files that could be downloaded.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png?resize=660%2C275" alt="2013" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499673" /></a></p>\n<p>Files named &#8220;index.html&#8221; were added to the main cache directories to stop remote users viewing the contents of the cache directories. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not possible to add empty index.html files to the supercache directories because those files could be served by accident to legitimate visitors of the site. However, the plugin will also add a directive that disables directory listings to the file cache/.htaccess. You can now also change the location of the cache directory on the Advanced Settings page of the plugin. If you can&#8217;t disable directory indexing on your server and you have private posts you should change this location and use PHP mode to serve cache files.</p>\n<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/cache-location.png?resize=660%2C314" alt="cache-location" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89499679" /></p>\n<p>If a directory index is found in the cache directory it will show a warning like this to administrators:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png?resize=660%2C231" alt="index.html warnings" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499671" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking the logout link will log everyone out, except the user who clicks it, but it guarantees that the login cookies are updated, just in case someone has copied the cookie from an old meta file. </p>\n<h3>Directory Traversal and File Deletion</h3>\n<p>User input in the settings page wasn&#8217;t properly sanitised. The code that sanitised directory paths when deleting cache files wasn&#8217;t secure and might allow an attacker to view or delete files named index.html. Deletes are protected by a nonce, limiting the useful lifetime of the URL however.</p>\n<h3>PHP Object Injection</h3>\n<p>The plugin used serialize and unserialize <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-object-injection?replies=2">to store data</a> in &#8220;legacy cache&#8221; meta files. This might be used to perform a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection">PHP object injection</a> attack. Serialised data is now stored as JSON data.</p>\n<p>The format of legacy cached files has changed. The files in the meta directory no longer have a .meta extension. They are .php files now and each file has a &#8220;die()&#8221; command to stop anyone loading them.<br />\nThe data stored in those files is now stored as JSON serialised data. The login cookie is an MD5 hash now as well.<br />\nWhen you upgrade the plugin your existing legacy cache files will be deleted and regenerated as visitors use your site.</p>\n<p>Apart from those security fixes there have been a number of enhancements and bugfixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Disabling the plugin no longer deletes the configuration file. Uninstalling will do that however.</li>\n<li> Enhancement: Only preload public post types. Props webaware.</li>\n<li> It&#8217;s now possible to deactivate the plugin without visiting the settings page.</li>\n<li> Fixed the cache rebuild system. Rebuild files were deleted immediately but now survive up to 10 seconds longer than the request that generate them.</li>\n<li> Minor optimisations: prune_super_cache() exits immediately if the file doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>\n<li> The output of wp_cache_get_cookies_values() is now cached per visit.</li>\n<li> Added PHP pid to the debug log to aid debugging.</li>\n<li> Various small bug fixes.</li>\n<li> Fixed reset of expiry time and GC settings when updating advanced settings.</li>\n<li> Removed CacheMeta class to avoid APC errors. It&#8217;s not used any more.</li>\n<li> Fixed reset of advanced settings when using &#8220;easy&#8221; settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release wouldn&#8217;t be possible without the help of <a href="https://kraft.im/">Brandon Kraft</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@dane">Dane Odekirk</a>, Ben Bidner, Jouko Pynnönen and <a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/">Scrutinizer</a>.

Not only was it an experiment to see what would happen but a new way for me to use WordPress. The experiment introduced me to several drawbacks in WordPress&#8217; comment moderation system.</p>\n<h2>Lack of Context</h2>\n<p>Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. Take the following screenshot for example. This comment is in response to a comment submitted by Norcross. Unless I open Norcross&#8217; comment in a new browser tab or window, I have no idea what the context of the conversation is. Pending notifications in the WordPress mobile app also don&#8217;t show text from the parent comment.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48150" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161" alt="WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area" /></a>WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area\n<p>I propose that WordPress core adds the text from parent comments to replies in the backend so I know what people are responding too. This also helps when replying to comments from the backend as I&#8217;ll know the context of the conversation.</p>\n<h2>Lack of Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved</h2>\n<p>WordPress does not send an email notification when a comment is approved from moderation. However, there are a lot of people <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">working to add</a> this feature to WordPress 4.4.</p>\n<h2>A Whitelisting System for Anonymous Comments</h2>\n<p>The biggest drawback to comment moderation is that not every comment needs to be moderated. A whitelisting system can lessen the burden of having to moderate each comment.</p>\n<p>WordPress provides the ability to blacklist comments. You can also configure a set of parameters to determine when a comment goes into the moderation queue such as, number of links, content within the comment, and if the comment author has a previously approved comment. None of these configurations are useful if WordPress is configured to send every comment to moderation.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern does not have open registration and allows comments from anonymous people. This makes whitelisting difficult since the IP address, name, URL, and email address of a commenter can easily change or be imitated. The whitelisting component of WordPress becomes more useful if you can tie it to a registered user account.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m unsure if WordPress can improve this area of the moderation system or if it&#8217;s an assumed risk administrators take when accepting anonymous comments.</p>\n<h2>A Major Time Suck</h2>\n<p>Moderating every comment is a pain and sucks up time that can be spent doing something else. During my vacation last week, I continued to moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app because if I didn&#8217;t, the conversation stopped. I&#8217;ve concluded that by accepting anonymous comments, there needs to be a way for the audience to help moderate instead of doing it on my own.</p>\n<p>In a future post, I&#8217;m going to list a few WordPress plugins I&#8217;ve discovered that takes the commenting system to the next level. Many of the plugins solve one or most of the problems listed above.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:52:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: WP Super Cache 1.4.5 Patches XSS Vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48336";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wptavern.com/wp-super-cache-1-4-5-patches-xss-vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:606:"<p>If you use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a>, you should immediately update to version 1.4.5 as it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/changelog/">patches a XSS vulnerability</a> in the settings page.

The South East Asian archipelago has becoming an increasingly attractive sourcing option for global brands and retailers as part of their China +1 strategy with Foxconn, for example, reported to be growing its manufacturing base into The Philippines also.\r\n\r\nHowever, a fire earlier this month at Kentex Manufacturing in Manila, which killed 72 workers, highlights the dangerous working conditions sometimes found in this increasingly important sourcing hub. The 2 story building, located in a northern suburb of Manila, was gutted when sparks, flying from a welding machine, ignited flammable chemicals stored close by.\r\n\r\nSince the factory was manufacturing for the local, Philippines, market, and not for western brands and retailers, it had not been subject to industry codes of conduct, nor third party monitoring, often a prerequisite to doing business. Certainly, a combination of better education, correct client pressure, as well third party monitoring, may have prevented this tragedy. The issues at Kentex could have been prevented through compliance with basic factory safety codes. For example, Kentex did not have a designated safety officer, responsible for the safe storage of flammable liquids, nor were there any alarms nor sprinklers at the factory. Further, workers could not find their way out of the factory safely and became trapped due to an insufficient number of fire exits and a locked door.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were more fundamental problems at play, commonplace across The Philippines, which combined with these more preventable issues to cause the tragedy. Firstly, there had been a significant failure by the local government who had issued Kentex with a business permit without requiring them to produce a valid, fire safety inspection certificate. The causes for this are unclear but local corruption is an ongoing challenge in The Philippines as is the need to increase tax revenues through encouraging local businesses. Also, Kentex was reported to have been dangerously overcrowded. This, however, would have been challenging to detect during a third party audit since the factory subcontracted the majority of its workforce and therefore the necessary employee records, which would have elevated this issue, would not have been available onsite.\r\n\r\nAs this tragedy illustrates, responsible sourcing is an ongoing, complex challenge. While compliance with basic safety measures should always be met, there are often more significant issues at hand. All too often fundamental failures at local level create a social responsibility vacuum which brands and retailers are expected to fill. It is crucial then that companies sourcing from these markets are provided with complete transparency over working conditions on the ground and receive expert advice.\r\n\r\nAs part of our global network, Omega has a fully staffed office in Manila.

Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‘reactive’ one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company’s anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture. Not only should the code of ethics be driven by senior management but there must be ‘support from the middle’; engraining integrity in day-to-day operations across the local offices and in the orientation of new employees.\r\n\r\nFundamental to a successful anti-corruption program should be regular integrity training at both corporate level and across local teams. The purpose of these training sessions are threefold; to introduce or elevate awareness, clarify a company’s expectations, and provide tools and resources to employees should they encounter unethical situations.\r\n\r\nOmega advocates training based on real-life scenarios, specific to each local market. It is important that employees understand a company’s expectations on handling of unethical situations, such as attempted bribery. For example, just because the employee didn’t accept a bribe doesn’t mean it wasn’t a bribe and it should therefore be reported.\r\n\r\nIn Omega’s experience, training sessions are typically followed by a spike in reports of unethical behavior allowing companies to understand where the potential hotspots may be and focus resources accordingly.\r\n\r\nManaging an anti-corruption program across multiple offices, in culturally distinct markets, can be daunting. Omega has vast experience dealing with supply chain integrity risks.

Omega''s approach is centered upon a real knowledge of the challenges, clear communications, a detailed corrective action plan agreed onsite and practical advice each step of the way.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Omega can support your business please <strong><a href="http://omega-v2.nowwhat.hk/contact/">contact us</a></strong>.\r\n<h2>SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY</h2>\r\nIn order to demonstrate compliance with international supply chain security standards, importers must continually assess their supply chains to identify, mitigate and eliminate potential security hazards as well as monitor ongoing improvements. Failure to comply with importer security requirements, such as C-TPAT and PIP, may result in Customs delaying your shipments or even having them seized at enormous cost to your business.\r\n\r\nOmega is an industry leader in the supply chain security field. We are expert at working with all supply chain partners, from manufacturers, warehouses, logistics providers to ports and perform in excess of 1,000 security audits each year across more than 20 countries worldwide. Omega has world-class account management experience; developing risk analyses and managing global supply chain security programs for some of the most prestigious importers into the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nYour supply chain is more complicated than you might think. With a wide network of suppliers, some large, some small, some experienced and some new, spread over many countries, effectively assuring a secure and compliant supply chain is a daunting challenge. Omega''s security expertise will guide you.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Omega can support your business please <strong><a href="http://omega-v2.nowwhat.hk/contact/">contact us</a></strong>.\r\n<h2>COUNTRY OF ORIGIN DUE DILIGENCE</h2>\r\nShould your company be benefitting from reduced tariffs under the benefits of specific free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the arrangement between The EU and ASEAN, it is imperative that your merchandise is in compliance with all Customs requirements. Should Customs choose to examine your merchandise and determine that it is eligible for duty free benefits then you may be fined and your shipments delayed.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this risk and to provide evidence of a rigorous due diligence process, Omega experts verify from where your supplier is manufacturing your merchandise as well as procuring the relevant raw materials.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Omega can support your business please <strong><a href="http://omega-v2.nowwhat.hk/contact/">contact us</a></strong>.', 'Auditing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '32-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-08-28 11:38:16', '2015-08-28 19:38:16', '', 32, 'http://omega-v2.nowwhat.hk/32-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(154, 2, '2015-09-28 01:01:39', '2015-09-28 09:01:39', 'Supply chain fraud and corruption affects everyone. On a micro level, it results in poorly qualified suppliers becoming part of your network, factories with egregious ethical issues becoming approved and defective shipments passed. On a macro level, a culture of corruption is demoralizing. Productivity declines, staff turnover increases and, otherwise ethical, employees become persuaded by corruption or leave the company.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to managing supply chain corruption is a ‘reactive’ one. Typically, an organization receives a complaint, either internally or externally, anonymous or otherwise, then launches a formal investigation. However, due to stringent worker protection laws, such as those in China and Vietnam (where a code of ethics may not be legally recognized), the burden of proof is stacked heavily in favor of the party laying the charge of corrupt practices. So much so that, even if there is strong evidence to support it, summary dismissal is often not upheld when challenged in a labor court. Even video evidence of an employee accepting a bribe can be deemed insufficient and, unless there is concrete proof that the suspect has requested payment, it is often the company, instead, which is taken to labor court. Given the limitations of this more traditional approach, it is critical that companies also take proactive measures.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous investigations should remain a cornerstone of any anti-corruption program, it is critical that companies adopt a holistic approach. Incorporating a successful, preventative program should keep good employees out of trouble and give those more inclined towards unethical behavior pause for thought and even redress.\r\n\r\nFront and center of a company’s anti-corruption program is its code of ethics. This should be communicated effectively across the company and embedded within its culture. Not only should the code of ethics be driven by senior management but there must be ‘support from the middle’; engraining integrity in day-to-day operations across the local offices and in the orientation of new employees.\r\n\r\nFundamental to a successful anti-corruption program should be regular integrity training at both corporate level and across local teams. The purpose of these training sessions are threefold; to introduce or elevate awareness, clarify a company’s expectations, and provide tools and resources to employees should they encounter unethical situations.\r\n\r\nOmega advocates training based on real-life scenarios, specific to each local market. It is important that employees understand a company’s expectations on handling of unethical situations, such as attempted bribery. For example, just because the employee didn’t accept a bribe doesn’t mean it wasn’t a bribe and it should therefore be reported.\r\n\r\nIn Omega’s experience, training sessions are typically followed by a spike in reports of unethical behavior allowing companies to understand where the potential hotspots may be and focus resources accordingly.\r\n\r\nManaging an anti-corruption program across multiple offices, in culturally distinct markets, can be daunting. Omega has vast experience dealing with supply chain integrity risks.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\r\n\r\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands’ commercial practices. Instead of ‘how can the industry move away from supplier auditing?’ the question should be ‘how can we utilize auditing more effectively?’\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\r\n\r\nWhile the industry isn’t ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program. These programs should then be managed by specialist consultants, in close partnership with brands’ ethical, and, ultimately, sourcing departments, responsible for leveraging relationships, by rewarding progress with business, or developing exit plans should corrective actions fail to be implemented.\r\n\r\nFactories should take ownership of their own compliance programs. However, before this is possible, suppliers must have the requisite knowledge of, and experience in, social compliance and remediation. Once they have reached this level they can then be charged with developing their own management systems. Re-audits, performed by specialist auditors, should be performed to ensure that their systems are sustainable.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any success though is transparency. If factories do not produce authentic wage and working hour records then the effectiveness of any audit and/or remediation program is severely handicapped. Key to any success in obtaining authentic records is the clear communication, on the part of the brands, that falsified records are unacceptable and that, in return for access to authentic documentation, the brand shall work with suppliers to reduce deficiencies, such as working hours, within an attainable timeframe. Omega works with a number of brands who have adopted this approach and has seen gains in access to authentic records by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in developing and managing social compliance audits programs across global supply chains.

The 2 story building, located in a northern suburb of Manila, was gutted when sparks, flying from a welding machine, ignited flammable chemicals stored close by.\r\n\r\nSince the factory was manufacturing for the local, Philippines, market, and not for western brands and retailers, it had not been subject to industry codes of conduct, nor third party monitoring, often a prerequisite to doing business. Certainly, a combination of better education, correct client pressure, as well third party monitoring, may have prevented this tragedy. The issues at Kentex could have been prevented through compliance with basic factory safety codes. For example, Kentex did not have a designated safety officer, responsible for the safe storage of flammable liquids, nor were there any alarms nor sprinklers at the factory. Further, workers could not find their way out of the factory safely and became trapped due to an insufficient number of fire exits and a locked door.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were more fundamental problems at play, commonplace across The Philippines, which combined with these more preventable issues to cause the tragedy. Firstly, there had been a significant failure by the local government who had issued Kentex with a business permit without requiring them to produce a valid, fire safety inspection certificate.

Also, Kentex was reported to have been dangerously overcrowded.

(180, 2, '2015-10-12 20:24:50', '2015-10-13 04:24:50', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

The 2 story building, located in a northern suburb of Manila, was gutted when sparks, flying from a welding machine, ignited flammable chemicals stored close by.\r\n\r\nSince the factory was manufacturing for the local, Philippines, market, and not for western brands and retailers, it had not been subject to industry codes of conduct, nor third party monitoring, often a prerequisite to doing business. Certainly, a combination of better education, correct client pressure, as well third party monitoring, may have prevented this tragedy. The issues at Kentex could have been prevented through compliance with basic factory safety codes. For example, Kentex did not have a designated safety officer, responsible for the safe storage of flammable liquids, nor were there any alarms nor sprinklers at the factory. Further, workers could not find their way out of the factory safely and became trapped due to an insufficient number of fire exits and a locked door.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were more fundamental problems at play, commonplace across The Philippines, which combined with these more preventable issues to cause the tragedy. Firstly, there had been a significant failure by the local government who had issued Kentex with a business permit without requiring them to produce a valid, fire safety inspection certificate. The causes for this are unclear but local corruption is an ongoing challenge in The Philippines as is the need to increase tax revenues through encouraging local businesses. Also, Kentex was reported to have been dangerously overcrowded. This, however, would have been challenging to detect during a third party audit since the factory subcontracted the majority of its workforce and therefore the necessary employee records, which would have elevated this issue, would not have been available onsite.\r\n\r\nAs this tragedy illustrates, responsible sourcing is an ongoing, complex challenge. While compliance with basic safety measures should always be met, there are often more significant issues at hand. All too often fundamental failures at local level create a social responsibility vacuum which brands and retailers are expected to fill.

Performed under the correct conditions, a robust audit program provides the most effective window into workplace conditions across your supply chain. In fact, the most socially responsible brands in the world, leaders within the industry, rely upon factory auditing, investing significantly in their programs, realizing its essential value.\n\nThe lack of sufficient progress in workplace conditions is not the fault of auditing, per se. Instead, it is, in part, due to how audits are actually performed, leveraged and integrated into brands’ commercial practices. Instead of ‘how can the industry move away from supplier auditing?’ the question should be ‘how can we utilize auditing more effectively?’\n\nThere are many examples of social compliance audits being utilized exceptionally well. One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples. These cases though are rare, occurring at the margins, due, largely, to an absence of trust between all parties as well as the important issue of transparency.\n\nWhile the industry isn’t ready for this model, significant improvements can still be made to strengthen the auditing process. Across the industry, the role of auditing, within a responsible sourcing program, needs to be defined more clearly. Too often auditing and remediation are conflated. The result being that unreasonable expectations are appropriated upon the auditing party. While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program.

(193, 2, '2015-10-14 18:01:22', '2015-10-15 02:01:22', 'A worst case scenario for any company is learning, either through the media or other sources that, not only are their products manufactured at factories with egregious workplace violations, but they were unaware that they were doing business with these manufacturers in the first place.\r\n\r\nSupply chain transparency is not as simple as it may seem. In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do? First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

One large manufacturing group, for example, performs internal audits upon its own factories. Issues, such as working hours, are identified by the audit then elevated to the clients, large apparel brands, who, with all the facts, make an informed decision to extend shipment windows, relieving pressures on working hours, or remain on course. The manufacturing group also analyzes its clients buying practices, reviewing how they impact social compliance, and makes recommendations to buyers based on practical examples.

While remediation / capacity building are important functions of a responsible sourcing program, social compliance auditing serves a different purpose and should operate separately. Audits should be performed by specialist auditors, providing a window into the actual conditions on the ground. After this baseline assessment, brands should then assess the circumstances of each factory; business relationship, shipment volume, as well as the types of issues identified, before deciding whether to invest in a remediation / capacity building program.

First and foremost, it is crucial that you understand where your Tier I factories are. While this is often an exhaustive exercise, once complete, and baseline audits performed at these sites, you have a clearer picture of your supply chain locations as well as conditions on the ground. With this information brands can then begin to understand where the risks are and dig deeper to learn whether subcontracting, and what types of subcontracting, is occurring. This can be achieved through by requiring factories to declare details of their subcontractors / Tier II factories. Subcontracting can also be detected through quality inspections, or onsite audits, where auditors form a judgment based on, among other examples, production capacity, types of machines or the contents of the raw material storage.\r\n\r\nIf unauthorized subcontracting is identified in a supply chain a decision needs to be made. If a factory is subcontracting entire orders then the brand may choose to disqualify it from future business. However, if the factory is openly subcontracting a process, such as the weaving of wicker baskets to homeworkers, then the brand may consider accepting this supply chain partner and perform an audit upon that site to assess its workplace conditions. However, the brands may wish to tailor the assessment since it will be performed upon a residence as opposed to a manufacturing site. While there remains some debate on the best way to manage subcontracting, the industry has made significant progress over the past 5 years and a number of leading brands have now built audits of Tier II suppliers into their core programs.\r\n\r\nOmega has vast experience in supply chain mapping and managing compliance programs across subcontractors.

In many cases the party with whom a company places its purchase order is little more than a sales office in New York, a vendor showroom in Taiwan or a shell company in Hong Kong with actual production occurring at an unnamed manufacturer, usually overseas, with whom it has only a tenuous business relationship.\r\n\r\nSupply chains are inherently murky. While the problem is less acute across apparel and footwear suppliers, more vertically integrated and benefitting from consistent business relationships, the issue is prevalent and a real challenge for companies looking to develop an effective program from the ground up. For companies to have a real understanding of the working conditions on the ground it is essential then that they dig beyond this first layer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to understand where your product is made is by demanding the information from your suppliers. However, in fear of being cut out of future transactions, suppliers are often reluctant to disclose these details. As such, buying relationships will need to be leveraged, with full disclosure a condition of business. Even then supply chain mapping can take months to complete.\r\n\r\nOnce a company has mapped their Tier I suppliers, it is important to consider the real possibility that their products are actually being manufactured elsewhere, further upstream in the supply chain. Subcontracting poses a real challenge to brands with the issue falling into two general categories.\r\n\r\nThe first category is where a manufacturer subcontracts a process, or several processes, to a third party, or third parties. In the case of a toy umbrella, for example, the vendor may declare the manufacturing site to be where the product is shipped from. However, this may be a simple assembly room with the fabric manufactured at factory A, the wooden handle at factory B and the spokes at factory C. Another example would be a basket facility in Indonesia or The Philippines for example. In this case the site, declared by the supplier, may be a simple packing room with the main production process subcontracted to homeworkers with the requisite skills for the creative, indigenous designs required by the buyer. This scenario is commonplace in India also where apparel manufacturers sometimes outsource delicate embroidery to workers based at their homes or in small, poorly regulated workshops.\r\n\r\nThe second scenario is where a factory accepts an order from a buyer but, due to capacity issues, or wanting to increase its margin, the factory subcontracts the entire order, or part of the order to a separate manufacturer without requesting permission from the client. This practice is not uncommon across the industry. In fact, it was thrown into sharp focus by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. Here, due to undisclosed subcontracting, a number of companies were unaware that their products were being manufactured at one of the many factories operating within the building.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges then what should companies do?
